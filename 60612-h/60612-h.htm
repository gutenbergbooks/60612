<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="I" id="I">I.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>The clear water of the little river,
in which the willows were mirrored
quiveringly, shallowed where a tiny
bar of silver-white sand thrust the
ripples aside. Thus confined, <a href="#i_010fp">the
stream sulked for a moment in a deep,
pellucid pool</a>, and then, with sudden
rush and gurgle, swept through a miniature
narrows and swirled about the
naked roots of the willows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_9">THE STREAM SULKED IN A DEEP, PELLUCID POOL.</a></div>
</div>

<p>With a quick plunge of the paddle
Ethan guided the canoe past the
threatening bar. A drooping branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
swept his face caressingly as the craft
gained the quiet water beyond. Here,
as though repentant of its impatience,
the river loitered and lapped about a
massive granite bowlder, tugging
playfully at the swaying ferns and
tossing scintillant drops upon the velvety
moss. To the left, the fringe of
woodland which, in friendly gossip,
had followed the little river for a quarter
of a mile, parted where a second
stream, scarcely more than a brook,
flowed placidly into the first. Reinforced,
the river widened a little and
went slowly, musically on under the
drooping branches, alternately sun-splashed
and shadowed, until it disappeared
at a distant turn. But the
canoe did not follow. Instead it
rocked lazily by the bowlder, while the
ripples broke gently against its
smooth sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>To the bole of an old willow which
dropped its leaves in autumn upon the
white sand-bar was nailed a weather-gray
board, on which faded letters
stated:</p>

<p class="noic">PRIVATE PROPERTY!</p>

<p class="noic">NO TRESPASSING!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/i_011_031.jpg" width="389" height="600"
     alt="NO TRESSPASSING" title="NO TRESSPASSING" />
</div>

<p>Ethan observed the warning meditatively.
In view of his later course
of action let us credit him with that
hesitation. At length, with a faint
smile on his face, he turned the nose
of the canoe toward the smaller
stream and his back to the sign.</p>

<p>To have observed him one would
scarcely have believed him capable of
deliberately committing the dire crime
of trespass. There was something
about his good-looking face which bespoke
honesty. At least, it would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
been difficult to credit him with underhand
methods; it seemed easier to believe
that if he ever did commit a
crime it would be in such a superbly
open and above-board fashion as to
rob it of half its iniquity. Not that
there was anything of classical beauty
about his face. His eyes were a shade
of brown, his nose was perhaps a
trifle too short to reach the standard
of the Grecians, his mouth, unhidden
by any mustache, did not to
any great extent suggest a Cupid’s
bow. His chin was aggressive. For
the rest, he had the usual allowance
of hair of a not uncommon shade of
brown, and showed, when he laughed
which was by no means infrequently—a
set of very white and very capable
looking teeth. And yet I reiterate my
former adjective; good-looking he
was; good-looking in a healthy, frank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
happy and rather boyish way that was
eminently satisfying.</p>

<p>If the sign on the old willow was
right, and he really was trespassing,
I have no excuse to offer, or at least
none that my conscience will allow me
to suggest. I can’t plead ignorance
for him, for the simple reason that he
had seen the sign and read it and that
he knew all about trespass—or as
much as was taught in the three-year
course at the Harvard Law School,
which he had finished barely a fortnight
ago.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he has been sending the
canoe quietly along the winding water
path, dipping the paddle with easy,
rhythmic swings of his shoulders,
pushing the blade astern through the
clear water and swinging it, flashing
and dripping, back for the next stroke.
He had tossed his light cloth cap into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the bottom of the canoe and had laid
his coat over a thwart. The summer
morning sunlight, slanting through
the branches, wove quickly vanishing
patterns in gold upon his brown hair.
The tiny breeze, just a mere breath
from the southwest, fragrant with the
odor of damp, sun-warmed soil and
greenery, stirred the sheer white shirt
he wore and laid it in folds under the
raised arm.</p>

<p>The brook was rather shallow;
everywhere the pebbled bottom was
visible. It was a whimsical brook,
full of sudden turns and twistings;
rounding tiny promontories of alder
and sheepberry, dipping into quiet
bays where bush honeysuckles were
dripping sweetness from their pale
yellow funnels, skirting curving
beaches of white sand where standing
armies of purple flags held themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
stiffly at attention and restrained
the invasion of the eager,
swaying fern-rabble.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 599px;">
<img src="images/i_014.jpg" width="599" height="600" alt="the brook" title="the brook" />
</div>

<p>He had gone several hundred yards
by this time against the slow current,
and now there was evident a change
in the foliage lining the banks, even
in the banks themselves. Artifice had
aided nature. Pink and white and yellow
lilies dotted the stream, while at
a little distance a slender, graceful
stone bridge arched from shore to
shore. Woodbine clustered about it
and threw cool, trembling leaf-shadows
against the sunlit stones. The
arch framed a charming vista of the
brook beyond. The canoe slipped
noiselessly under the bridge and the
strip of shadow rested gratefully for
an instant on Ethan’s face. On the
left there was a momentary break in
the foliage and a brief glimpse of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
wide expanse of velvety turf. Then
another turn, the canoe brushing aside
the broad lily-pads, and the end of the
journey had come, and, sitting with
motionless paddle, he gazed spellbound.</p>

<div class="chapter">

</div>


<p>The banks of the stream fell suddenly
away on either side and the
canoe glided slowly and softly into a
miniature lake. It was perhaps twenty
yards across at its widest place
and much more than that in length.
Occasionally a far-reaching branch
threw trembling shadows on the
water, but for the most part the trees
stood back from the margin of the
pool and allowed the fresh green turf
to descend unhampered to the water’s
edge. At a point farthest from where
Ethan had entered a little cascade
tumbled. On all sides the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
sloped slightly upward, and in one
place a group of larches crowned the
summit of a knoll and mingled their
delicate branches far above the neighboring
maples. Almost concealed
among them an uncertain gleam of
white caught at moments through the
trees to the right suggested a building
of some sort—perhaps the marble
temple of the divinity, who, seated on
the bank with her bare sandaled feet
crossed before her, observed the intruder
with calm, dreamy, almost smiling
unconcern.</p>

<img src="images/i_019bottom.jpg" width="345" height="135"

</div>

<p>It was a beautiful scene into which
Ethan had floated. Overhead was a
blue sky against which a few soft
white clouds hung seemingly motionless
as though, like Narcissus, they
had become enamored of their reflections
in the pool there below. On a
tiny islet in the pool, dwarf willows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
caressed the water with the tips of
their pendulous branches. Further on a
trio of white swans sunned themselves,
and about the margin the bosom of
the pool was carpeted with lily-pads
and starred with a multitude of fragrant
blooms, white, rose-hued, carmine,
pale violet, sulphur-colored
and blue. The gauze wings of darting
dragon-flies caught the sunlight, insects
hovered above the flower-cups
and in the branches around many a
feathered cantatrice was singing her
heart out. And for background there
was always the varied green of encircling
trees.</p>

<p>Yes, it was very beautiful, but
Ethan had no eyes for it. With paddle
still suspended between gunwale
and water he was staring in a fashion
at once depicting surprise, curiosity,
and admiration at the figure on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
grass. And what wonder? <a href="#i_020fp">Who
would have thought to find a Grecian
goddess under New England skies?</a>
Ethan’s thoughts leaped back to mythology
and he sought a name for her.
Diana? Minerva? Venus? Iris?
Penelope?</p>

<p>And all the while—a very little
while despite the telling—his eyes
ranged from the sandaled feet to the
warm brown hair with its golden fillet.
A single garment of gleaming white
reached from the feet to the shoulders
where it was caught together on either
side with a metal clasp. The arms
were bare, youthfully slender, aglow
in the sunlight. And yet it was to the
eyes that his gaze returned each time.
“Minerva!” his thoughts triumphed,
“‘Minerva, goddess azure-eyed!’”
And yet in the next instant he knew
that while her eyes were undeniably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
blue she was no wise Minerva. Such
youthful softness belonged rather to
Iris or Daphne or Syrinx.</p>

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_20">WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT TO FIND A GRECIAN GODDESS UNDER NEW ENGLAND SKIES?</a></div>
</div>

<p>And all the while—just the little
time it took for the canoe to glide
from the stream well into the pool—she
had been regarding him tranquilly
with her deep blue eyes, her bare arms,
stretching downward to the grass,
supporting her in an attitude suggesting
recent recumbency. And now, as
the craft brushed the lily-pads aside,
she spoke.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 236px;">
<img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="236" height="600"
     alt="Clytie" title="Clytie" />
</div>

<p>“Do you not fear the resentment
of the gods?” she asked gravely.
“It is not wise for a mortal to look
upon us.”</p>

<p>“I crave your mercy, O fair goddess,”
he answered. “Blame rather
this tiny argosy of mine which, propelled
by hands invisible, has brought
me hither. I doubt not that the gods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
hold me in enchantment.” He mentally
patted himself on the back; it
wasn’t so bad for an impromptu!</p>

<p>She leaned forward and sunk her
chin in the cup of one small hand,
viewing him intently as though pondering
his words.</p>

<p>“It may be so,” she answered presently.
“What call you your frail
vessel?”</p>

<p>“From this hour, Good Fortune.”
Her gaze dropped.</p>

<p>“Will you deign to tell me your
name, O radiant goddess?” he continued.
She raised her eyes again and
he thought a little smile played for a
moment over her red lips.</p>

<p>“I am Clytie,” she answered, “a
water-nymph. I dwell in this pool.
And you, how are you called?”</p>

<p>He answered readily and gravely:
“I am Vertumnus, clad thus in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
mortal guise that I may gain the presence
of Pomona. Long have I wooed
her, O Nymph of the Pool.”</p>

<p>“I too love unrequited,” she answered
sadly. “Apollo has my heart.
Though day by day I watch him drive
his fiery chariot across the heavens
he sees me not.”</p>

<p>She arose and turned her face upward
to the sun. <a href="#i_022fp">Slowly she raised
her white arms</a> and stretched them
forth in tragic appeal.</p>

</div>

<p>“Apollo!” she cried. “Apollo!
Hear me! Clytie calls to you!”</p>

<p>Such a passion of melancholy longing
spoke in her voice that Ethan
thrilled in spite of himself. Unconsciously
his gaze followed hers to the
blazing orb. The light dazzled his
eyes and blinded him for a moment.
When he looked again toward the bank
it was empty, but between the trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
along the slope, a white garment fluttered
and was lost to sight.</p>

</div>

<p>“Clytie!” he called in sudden dismay.
And again.</p>

<p>“Clytie!”</p>

<p>A wood-thrush in a nearby tree
burst into golden melody. But Clytie
answered not.</p>

<p>The Roadside Inn at Riverdell
sprawls its white length along the old
post-road over which many years ago
the coaches swayed and rattled between
New York and Boston. The
Roadside, known in those days as Peppit’s
Tavern, has changed but little.
The front room over the porch, has
held notable guests: Washington,
Hancock, Adams, Lafayette and many
more. On the tap-room windows you
may still find the diamond-etched initials
of by-gone celebrities. And much
of the old-time atmosphere remains.</p>

</div>

<p>The room into which Ethan had his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
bag taken after his return from his
adventure in Arcady was low-ceilinged
and dim. The two small windows,
one overlooking the dilapidated
orchard at the rear and the little river
beyond, the other revealing the murmuring
depths of a big elm, afforded
little light. The floor was delightfully
uneven; Ethan went downhill to the
washstand and uphill again to the old
mahogany bureau. The wide fire-place
held a pair of antique andirons
coveted by many a visitor, and the
narrow shelf above was adorned with
an equally desirable brass candlestick
and a couple of opaque white glass
vases which, ancient as they were,
post-dated the shelf itself by half a
hundred years. The bedstead, of mahogany,
with rolling footboard, had
made concessions to modernity. The
pegs along the side, from which ropes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
had once been stretched, remained, but
an up-to-date wire spring and hair
mattress had superseded the olden
furnishings.</p>

</div>

<p>Ethan lighted a cigarette, unstrapped
his bag and took out a leathern
portfolio. With this on his knee,
he sat at one of the open windows and
scrawled a note.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 183px;">

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Vin, I am sending my man Farrell on
to you with the machine with orders to place it
at your disposal. Make what use you can of
it. I think it is all right now, though it went
back on us this morning about two miles north
of here. Funny place for it to bust, wasn’t
it; looks as though it meant me to pay a visit
here, eh? Well, I’m humoring it. I’ve decided
to stay here for a day or two at the Roadside.
I want to brush up a bit on mythology. Very
interesting subject, mythology, Vin. Just when
I’ll follow the machine I can’t say yet; possibly
in a day or two. Make my excuses to your
mother and sisters; invent any old story you
like. You might say, for instance, that Vertumnus,
fickle god, has transferred his affections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
from Pomona to a water-nymph. But
you needn’t if you’d rather not. I don’t care
what you say. Expect me when you see me.</p>

<p class="noic">“Yours,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Ethan</span>.”<br /></p>
</div>

<p>With a smile as he thought of his
friend’s perplexity on reading the
note, Ethan folded it and tucked it
into an envelope. Then addressing it
to “Mr. Vincent Graves, The Boulders,
Stillhaven, Mass.,” he sealed it,
dropped it into his pocket and made
his way downstairs to dinner.</p>

<p>After dinner a big blue touring-car
chugged its way southward along the
shaded road, with Farrell at the wheel
and Ethan’s note in Farrell’s pocket.
Ethan watched it disappear. Then,
drawing a chair to the edge of the
porch, he set himself in it, put his
heels on the railing, stuffed his hands
into his pockets and asked himself with
a puzzled smile why he had done it.</p>

<p>The grass grew tall and lush under
the gnarled old apple-trees back of
the Inn, and the straggling footpath
which led to the landing was a path
only in name. By the time he had
gained the river Ethan’s immaculate
white shoes were slate-colored with
dew. The canoe rested on two poles
laid from crotches of the apple trees,
which overhung the stream. Ethan
lifted it down and dropped it into the
water. With paddle in hand he stepped
in and pushed off down-stream.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_029_113.jpg" width="600" height="177"
     alt="river back of the Inn" title="river back of the Inn" />
</div>

<p>On his left the orchard and garden
of the Inn marched with him for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
way, giving place at length to a neck
of woodland. On his right, seen between
the twisted willows, stretched
a pleasant view of meadows and tilled
fields in the foreground, and, beyond,
the gently rising hills, wooded save
where along the base the encroaching
grasslands rose and dipped. A couple
of sleepy-looking farmhouses were
nestled in the middle-distance and the
faint <em>whir-r-r</em> of a mowing machine
floated across the meadows. In the
high grass daisies were sprinkled as
thickly as stars in the Milky Way, and
buttercups thrust their tiny golden
bowls above the pendulous plumes of
the timothy, foxtail, and fescue. The
blue-eyed grass, too, was all abloom,
like miniatures of the blue flags which
congregated wherever the spring
floods had inundated the meadows.</p>

<p>The sand-bar came in sight and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
little river began to fuss and fret as
it gathered itself for what it doubtless
believed to be an awe-inspiring rush.
The canoe bobbed gracefully through
the rapids and swung about in the
pool below. Ethan winked soberly at
the sign on the willow tree and dipped
his paddle again. The canoe breasted
the lazy current of the brook.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/i_011_031.jpg" width="389" height="600"
     alt="NO TRESPASSING" title="NO TRESPASSING" />
</div>

<p>It was just such a day as yesterday.
The little breeze stirred the rushes
along the banks and brought odors
of honeysuckle. Fleecy white clouds
seemed to float on the unshadowed
stretches of the stream. On one side
a sudden blur of deep pink marked
where a wild azalea was ablossom.
Again, a glimpse of white showed a
viburnum sprinkling the ground with
its tiny blooms. Cinnamon ferns were
pushing their pale bronze “fiddle-heads”
into the air. Now and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
a wood lily displayed a tardy blossom.
Near the stone bridge a kingfisher
darted downward to the brook, broke
its surface into silver spray and arose
on heavy wing.</p>

<p>Once past the bridge and with only
a single winding of the brook between
him and the lotus pool, Ethan trailed
his paddle for a moment while he
asked himself whether he really expected
to find the girl waiting for him.
Of course he didn’t, only—well, there
was just a chance——! Nonsense;
there was not the ghost of a chance!
Oh, very well; at least there was no
harm in his paddling to the lotus pool—barring
that he was trespassing!
He smiled at that. He smiled at it
several times, for some reason or
other. Then he dipped his paddle
again and sent the “Good Fortune”
gliding swiftly over the sunlit water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of the pond. And when he looked
there she was, seated on the bank, just
as—and he realized it now—he had
expected all along that she would be!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_033.jpg" width="600" height="415"

</div>

<p>But it was not Clytie he saw; not
unless the fashions have changed considerably
and water-nymphs may
wear with perfect propriety white
shirtwaist suits and tan shoes. It was
not impossible, he reasoned; for all
he knew to the contrary, the July number
of the Goddesses’ Home Journal—doubtless
edited by Minerva—might
prescribe just such garments for informal
morning wear. At all events,
being less <em>bizarre</em> than the flowing
peplum of yesterday, Ethan—whose
tastes in attire were quite orthodox—liked
it far better. The effect was
quite different, too. Yesterday she
might have been Clytie; to-day reason
cried out against any such possibility;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
she was a very modern-appearing and
extremely charming young lady of, apparently,
twenty or twenty-one years
of age, with a face, at present seen in
profile, piquant rather than beautiful.
The nose was small and delicate, the
mouth, under a short lip, had the least
bit of a pout and the chin was softly
round and sensitive. This morning
she wore her hair in a pompadour,
while at the back the thick braids
started low on her neck and coiled
around and around in a perfectly delightful
and absolutely puzzling fashion.
Ethan liked her hair immensely.
It was light brown, with coppery tones
where the sunlight became entangled.
She was seated on the sloping bank,
her hands clasped about her knees
and her gaze turned dreamily toward
the cascade which sparkled and tinkled
at the upper curve of the pool. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
canoe had made almost no sound in its
approach, she was, of course, ignorant
of Ethan’s presence. And yet it may
be mentioned as an interesting if
unimportant fact that as he gazed
at her for the space of half a minute
a rosy tinge, all unobserved of
him, crept into her cheeks. He
laid his paddle softly across the canoe,
and,——</p>

<p>“Greetings, O Clytie!” he said.</p>

<p>She turned to him startledly. A little
smile quivered about her lips.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Vertumnus,” she
answered. Perhaps his gaze showed
a trifle too much interest, for after
a brief instant hers stole away. He
picked up the paddle and moved the
canoe closer to the shore.</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to find you have
not yet taken root,” he said gravely.</p>

<p>“Taken root?” she echoed vaguely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, for that was your fate at the
last, wasn’t it? If I am not mistaken
you sat for days on the ground, subsisting
on your tears and watching
the sun cross the heavens, until at last
your limbs became rooted to the
ground and you just naturally turned
into a sunflower. At least, that’s the
way I recollect it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you shouldn’t tell me what
my fate is to be,” she answered smilingly.</p>

<p>“Forearmed is forewarned; no, I
mean the other way around!” he replied.
“Maybe if you just keep your
feet moving you’ll escape that fate.
It would be awfully uncomfortable, I
should say! Besides, pardon me if
it sounds rude, sunflowers are such
unattractive things, don’t you think
so?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_036.jpg" width="600" height="252"
     alt="lily pads" title="lily pads" />
</div>

<p>“Yes, I’m afraid they are. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
fate of Daphne or Lotis or Syrinx
would be much nicer.”</p>

<p>“What happened to them, please?”</p>

<p>“Why, Daphne was changed to a
laurel; have you forgotten?”</p>

<p>“No, but how about the other
ladies?”</p>

<p>“Lotis became a lotus and Syrinx a
clump of reeds. Pan gathered some
and made himself pipes to play on.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘Poor nymph!—Poor Pan!—how he did weep to find<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Naught but a lovely sighing of the wind<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Full of sweet desolation—balmy pain.’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Shelley, for a dollar,” he said
questioningly.</p>

<p>She shook her head smilingly.
“Keats,” she corrected.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have a way of getting them
mixed, those two chaps.” He paused.
“Do you know, it sounds odd nowadays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to hear anyone quote poetry?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it does; I dare say it
sounds very silly.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it! I like it! I wish
I could do it myself. All I know,
though, is</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘The Lady Jane was tall and slim,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The Lady Jane was fair,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="noi">and so on. I used to recite that at
school when I was a youngster; knew
it all through; and I think there were
five or six pages of it. I was quite
proud of that, and used to stand on the
platform Saturday mornings and just
gallop it off. I think the humor appealed
to me.”</p>

<p>“It must have been delightful!”
she laughed. “But you haven’t got
even that quite right!”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I? I dare say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, Sir Thomas was <em>her</em> lord, not
<em>my</em> lord, and it was his cough that was
short instead of his breath.”</p>

<p>“Shows that my memory is failing
at last,” he answered. “But, tell
me, do you know every piece of poetry
ever written?”</p>

<p>“No, not so many. I happen to remember
that, though. Besides, we
dwellers on Olympus hold poetry in
rather more respect than you mortals.”</p>

<p>“You forget that I am Vertumnus,”
he answered haughtily.</p>

<p>“Of course! And you puzzled me
with that yesterday, too. I had to go
home and hunt up a dictionary of
mythology to see who Vertumnus
was.”</p>

<p>“I—I trust you found him fairly
respectable?” he asked. “To tell
the truth, I don’t recollect very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
about him myself; and some of those
old chaps were—well, a bit rapid.”</p>

<p>“Vertumnus was quite respectable,”
she replied. “In fact, he was
quite a dear, the way he slaved to win
Pomona. I never cared very much
about Pomona,” she added frankly.</p>

<p>“I—I never knew her very well,”
he answered carelessly.</p>

<p>“I think she was a stick.”</p>

<p>“You forget,” he said gently,
“that you are speaking of the lady
of my affections.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry!” she cried
contritely. “Please forgive me!”</p>

<p>“If you will let me smoke a cigarette.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Considering that I am
on shore and you on the water it hardly
seems necessary——”</p>

<p>“Well, of course it’s your own private
pool,” he said. “I thought perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
nymphs objected to the odor of
cigarette-smoke around their habitations.”</p>

<p>“This nymph doesn’t mind it,” she
answered.</p>

<p>He selected a cigarette from his
case very leisurely. He had had several
opportunities to see her eyes and
was wondering whether they were
really the color they seemed to be.
He had thought yesterday that they
were blue, like the sky, or a Yale flag
or—or the ocean in October; in short
just <em>blue</em>. But to-day, seen from a
distance of some fifteen feet, and examined
carefully, they appeared quite
a different hue, a—a violet, or—or
mauve. He wasn’t sure just what
mauve was, but he thought it might be
the color of her eyes. At all events,
they weren’t merely blue; they were
something quite different, far more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
wonderful, and infinitely more beautiful.
He would look again just as soon
as he had the cigarette lighted,
and——</p>

<p>“Were you surprised to find me
here this morning?” she asked suddenly.
There was no hint of coquetry
in her tone and he stifled the first reply
occurring to him.</p>

<p>“I—no, I wasn’t—for some reason,”
he answered honestly. “I dare
say I ought to have been.”</p>

<p>“I came on purpose to meet you,”
she said calmly.</p>

<p>“Er—thank you—that is——!”</p>

<p>“I wanted to explain about yesterday.
You see I didn’t want you to
think I was just simply insane. There
was—method in my madness.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 311px;">
<img src="images/i_042_143.jpg" width="311" height="600"
     alt="foliage" title="foliage" />
</div>

<p>“But I didn’t think you insane,” he
denied, depositing the burnt match
carefully on a lily-pad and raising his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
gaze to hers. “I thought—that——”</p>

<p>“Yes, go on,” she prompted.
“Tell me what you did think when
you found me here in that—that
<em>thing</em>!”</p>

<p>“I thought I was in Arcadia and
that you were just what you said you
were, a water-nymph.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she murmured disappointedly;
“I thought you were really
going to tell me the truth.”</p>

<p>“I will, then. Frankly, I didn’t
know what to think. You said you
were Clytie, and far be it from me to
question a lady’s word. I was
stumped. I tried to work it out yesterday
afternoon and couldn’t, and so
I came back to-day in the hope that
I might have the good fortune to see
you again.”</p>

<p>“It was rather silly,” she answered.
“And I ought to have run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
away when I saw your canoe coming.
But it was so unexpected and sudden,
and I was bored and—and I wondered
what you would look like when I told
you I was a water-nymph!” She
laughed softly. “Only,” she went on
in a moment, with grievance in her
tones, “you didn’t look at all surprised!
I might just as well have
said ‘I am Mary Smith’ or—or
‘Laura Devereux!’”</p>

<p>(“Aha!” quoth Ethan to himself,
“I am learning.”)</p>

<p>“You were very disappointing,”
she concluded severely.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, really. I realize now
that I should have displayed astonishment
and awe. Perhaps if you had
said you were Laura—Laura Devereux,
was it?—I would have really
shown some emotion.”</p>

<p>“Why?” she questioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, don’t you think—Laura,
now, is—I’m afraid I can’t just explain.”
He was watching her intently.
She was studying her clasped
hands. “I suppose what I meant was
that Laura is such an attractive name,
so—so musical, so melodious! And
then coupled with Devereux it is even—even—er—more
so!”</p>

<p>“Is it?” She didn’t look at him
and her tone was almost icy.</p>

<p>(“I fancy that’ll hold you for
awhile,” he said to himself. “My
boy, you’re inclined to be a little too
fresh; cut it out!”)</p>

<p>“I never thought Laura especially
melodious,” she said.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are prejudiced,” he
suggested amiably.</p>

<p>“Why should I be?” she asked, observing
him calmly. He hesitated and
paid much attention to his cigarette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no reason at all, I suppose,”
he answered finally. He looked up in
time to surprise a little mocking smile
in her eyes. Nonsense! He’d show
her that she couldn’t bluff him down
like that! “To be honest,” he continued,
“what I meant was that some
folks take a dislike to their own
names; in which case they are scarcely
impartial judges.” He looked
across at her challengingly. She returned
the look serenely.</p>

<p>“So you think that is my name?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you should think
so,” she parried. “I might have
found it in a novel. I’m sure it sounds
like a name out of a novel.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t denied it,” he
insisted.</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to,” she replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the little tantalizing smile quivering
again at the corners of her mouth.
“Besides, I have already told you
that my name is Clytie.”</p>

<p>He tossed the remains of his cigarette
toward where one of the swans
was paddling about. The long neck
writhed snake-like and the bill disappeared
under the water. Then with
an insulted air and an angry bob of
the tail, the swan turned her back
on Ethan and sailed hurriedly back
to her family.</p>

<p>“I understand,” he said. “I will
try not to forget hereafter that this is
Arcadia, that you are Clytie and that
I am Vertumnus.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Vertumnus,” she
said. “And now I must tell you what
I came here to tell. You must know,
sir, that I am not in the habit of sitting
around on the grass in broad daylight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
dressed—as I was yesterday.
If I did I should probably catch
cold. Yesterday morning we—a friend
and I—dressed up in costume and
took each other’s pictures up there
under the trees. Afterwards the fancy
took me to come down here and—and
‘make believe.’ And then you
popped on to the scene all of a
sudden.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="410" height="600"
     alt="Clytie" title="Clytie" />
</div>

<p>“I see. Very rude of me, I’m sure.
Of course, as we are in Arcady, and
you are a nymph and I a—a god, I
don’t understand at all what you are
talking about; but I <em>would</em> like to see
those pictures!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you never will,” she
laughed.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure,” he said thoughtfully.
“Strange things happen in—Arcady.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you the least bit surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
when you saw me? And when
I—acted so silly?”</p>

<p>“I certainly was! Really, for a
while—especially after you had gone—I
was half inclined to think that I
had been dreaming. You did it rather
well, you know,” he added admiringly.</p>

<p>“Did I?” She seemed pleased.
“Didn’t it sound terribly foolish
when I spouted that about Apollo?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit! I—I half expected the
sun to do something when you raised
your hands to it; I don’t know just
what; wink, perhaps, or have an
eclipse.”</p>

<p>“You’re making fun of me!” she
said dolefully.</p>

<p>“But I am not, truly! However, I
don’t think you treated your audience
very nicely. To get me sun-blind and
then steal away wasn’t kind. When
I looked around you had simply disappeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
as though by magic, and I—”
he shivered uncomfortably—“I felt a
bit funny for a moment.”</p>

<p>“Really?” She positively beamed
on him, and Ethan felt a sudden
warmth at his heart. “I suppose
every person has a sneaking desire to
act,” she went on. “I know I have.
Ever since I was a little girl I’ve loved
to—to ‘make believe.’ That’s why I
did it yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever considered a stage
career?” he asked gravely. She
leaned her chin in one small palm and
observed him doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I never seem to know for certain,”
she complained, “whether you
are making fun of me or not. And I
don’t like to be made fun of—especially
by——”</p>

<p>“Strangers? I don’t blame you, Miss—Clytie.
I wouldn’t like it myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>She continued to study him perplexedly,
a little frown above her
somewhat impertinent nose. Ethan
smiled composedly back. He enjoyed
it immensely. The sunlight made
strange little golden blurs in her eyes.
They were very beautiful eyes; he
realized it thoroughly; and he didn’t
care how long she allowed him to look
into them like this. Only, well, it was
a bit disquieting to a chap. He could
imagine that invisible wires led from
those violet orbs of hers straight down
to his heart. Otherwise how account
for the tingling glow that was pervading
the latter? Not that it was unpleasant;
on the contrary——</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?” he stammered.</p>

<p>“I merely said that I had no idea
of the stage,” she replied distantly,
dropping her gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh!” He paused. It took him
a moment to get the sense of what
she had said through his brain.
Plainly, Arcadian air possessed a
quality not contained in ordinary
ether, and its effect was strangely
deranging to the senses. “Oh!” he
repeated presently, “I am glad you
haven’t. I shouldn’t want you to—er——”</p>

<p>But that didn’t appear to be just
the right thing to say, judging from
the sudden expression of reserve
which settled over her countenance.
Ethan shook himself awake.</p>

<p>“It is time for me to go,” she said,
getting to her feet. Ethan made an
absurdly futile motion toward assisting
her. <a href="#i_052fp">“I think I have explained
matters, don’t you?”</a></p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_52">“I THINK I HAVE EXPLAINED MATTERS, DON’T YOU?”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“You have explained,” he answered
judicially, “but there is much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
more that would bear, that even demands
elucidation.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that there is,” she replied
a trifle coldly.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, if you prefer to
have me place my own interpretation
on—things——!”</p>

<p>“What things?” she demanded
curiously.</p>

<p>“What things?” he repeated
vaguely. “Oh, why—er—lots,” he
ended lamely.</p>

<p>She turned her back.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” she said.</p>

<p>He took a desperate resolve.</p>

<p>“Good morning. Now that I know
who you are——”</p>

<p>“You don’t know who I am!” she
retorted, facing him defiantly.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but——”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say my name was—that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I know more besides,” he
added mysteriously.</p>

<p>“You don’t!”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well.” He smiled superiorly.</p>

<p>“How could you?”</p>

<p>“You forget that we gods have
powers of——”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, tell me, then.”</p>

<p>“Not to-day,” he answered gently.
“To-morrow, perhaps.”</p>

<p>He raised his paddle and turned the
canoe about.</p>

<p>“But you will not see me to-morrow,”
she said, stifling the smile that
threatened to mar her severity.</p>

<p>“You are not thinking of leaving
Arcady?” he asked in surprise.
“Where, pray, could you find a
more delightful pool than this?
Observe those swans! Observe the
lilies! Besides, even in Arcady one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
doesn’t move so late in the season.”</p>

</div>

<p>She regarded him for a moment
with intense gravity. Then,</p>

<p>“You really think so?” she asked
musingly.</p>

<p>“I really do.”</p>

<p>He waited, wondering at himself
for caring so much about her decision.
At last,</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” she said.
“Good morning.”</p>

<p>“And I, shall see you to-morrow?”
he cried eagerly.</p>

<p>She turned under the first tree.
The green shadows played over her
hair and dappled her white gown with
tremulous silhouettes.</p>

<p>“That,” she laughed softly, tantalizingly,
“is in the hands of the
gods.”</p>

<p>Her dress showed here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
through the trees for a moment and
then was lost to sight. Ethan heaved
a sigh. Then he smiled. Then he
seized the paddle and shot the canoe
toward the outlet.</p>

<p>Ethan laid aside his paddle and
mopped his face with his handkerchief.
The canoe, left to its own devices,
poked its nose against the
meadow bank and allowed its stern to
float slowly around in the languid current.
He gazed across the fields over
which the heat-waves danced and
shimmered and addressed himself to
his cigarette case.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 495px;">

<p>“Providence,” he said, “showed
great wisdom when it arranged that
the Pilgrims should land on the coast
of Massachusetts. ‘From what I’ve
seen of these folks and what I’ve
heard about them,’ says Providence,
‘I don’t believe they’re going to be
much of an acquisition to the New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
World. But I’ll give ’em a fair show.
I’ll see that they land at Plymouth
and if they can survive a Massachusetts
winter <em>and</em> a Massachusetts summer
I’ll have nothing more to say.
Those of them alive a year from now
will be entitled to prizes in the Endurance
Test and will have qualified
to become Hardy Pioneers and build
up the country.’”</p>

<p>He mopped his face again, lighted a
cigarette and took up his paddle.</p>

<p>“One would think that this state
might show moderation at some
season of the year,” he added disgustedly.
“But not content with her
Old Fashioned Winters, Backward
Springs and Early Falls she has to
try and wrest the Hot Weather blue
ribbon from Arizona! No wonder
they say a Bostonian isn’t contented
in Heaven; doubtless he finds the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
weather frightfully equable and monotonous!”</p>

<p>He righted the canoe and went on,
with a glance at the sky above the
hills.</p>

<p>“We’re probably in for a jolly
good thunder-storm this afternoon,”
he muttered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_059.jpg" width="600" height="313"
     alt="more river" title="more river" />
</div>

<p>By the time he had reached the entrance
to the brook his forehead was
again beaded with perspiration and
his thin negligée shirt showed a disposition
to cling to his shoulders. It
was one of those intensely hot and exceedingly
humid days which the early
summer so often visits upon New England.
Even the birds seemed to feel
the heat and instead of singing and
darting about across the shadowed
stream were content to flutter and
chirp drowsily amidst the branches.
The hum of the insects held a lethargic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
tone that somehow, like a locust’s
clatter in August, seemed to increase
the heat. Ethan went slowly up the
winding stream with divided opinions
on the subject of his own sanity. To
sit in a canoe in the broiling sun on a
morning like this merely to talk to a
girl was rank idiocy, he told himself.
Then he recalled her eyes, her tantalizing
little laugh, the soft tones of her
voice, the provocative ghost of a smile
that so often trembled about her red
lips, and owned that she was worth it.
After he had slipped under the stone
footbridge it suddenly occurred to
him that perhaps the girl would object
quite as strongly as he to making a
martyr of herself in the interests of
polite conversation! Perhaps she
wouldn’t come at all! In which case
he would have had his journey for
naught—and possibly a sunstroke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
thrown in! The more he considered
that possibility the more reasonable
it became, until, when he had shot the
canoe into the little pond, and saw that
the bank was empty of aught save a
pair of the swans who were stretching
their wings in the sunlight, he was
not surprised.</p>

<p>“She certainly has more sense than
I have,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Not a breath of air stirred the
leaves of the encircling fringe of trees.
The little lake was like an artist’s
palette set with all the tender greens
and pinks and whites and yellows of
summer.</p>

<p><a href="#i_060fp">“I hope you like my pool?” inquired
a voice.</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">
<a id="i_060fp">
  <img src="images/i_060fp.jpg" width="452" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_61">“I HOPE YOU LIKE MY POOL?” INQUIRED A VOICE.</a></div>
</div>

<p>Ethan turned from his survey of the
scene and saw that the girl was standing
under the shade of a willow a little
distance up the slope. She was all in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
white, as yesterday, but a broad-brimmed
hat of soft white straw hid
her hair and threw a shadow over her
face. Ethan raised his own less picturesque
panama and bowed.</p>

<p>“It’s looking fine to-day, I think,”
he answered. “Perhaps just a little
bit ornate, though. There’s such a
thing as over-decorating even a lotus
pool.”</p>

<p>He turned the bow of the canoe toward
the bank, swung it skilfully and
stepped ashore. The girl watched him
silently. When he had pulled the nose
of the craft onto the grass and
dropped his paddle he walked toward
her. A little flush crept into her
cheeks, but her eyes met his calmly.</p>

<p>“This is all dreadfully wrong, you
know,” she said gravely. He stopped
a few feet away and fanned himself
with his hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, very warm, isn’t it?” he
agreed affably.</p>

<p>“In the first place,” she went on
severely, “you are trespassing.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?” he asked
as though he had not comprehended.</p>

<p>“I said you are trespassing.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Yes, of course. Well, really,
you couldn’t expect me to sit out there
in that hot sun, could you now? I—I
have a rather delicate constitution.”</p>

<p>“But you were trespassing before!
Coming up here only makes it worse.”</p>

<p>“Better, I call it,” he answered,
turning to look back unregretfully at
the pool.</p>

<p>“And then—then it is equally
wrong for me to stay here and talk
to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh come now!” he objected.
“Nymphs in my day were not so conventional!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“So I shall leave you,” she continued,
unheeding and turning away.</p>

<p>“Then I shall go with you.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t dare!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Why not? Really, Miss Clytie, I
am fairly respectable and I know of
no reason why you shouldn’t be seen
in my company. I have never done
murder and never stolen less than a
million dollars at a time. To be sure,
I hope to become a practising attorney
in the course of a year or so, but
as yet my honor is unsullied.”</p>

<p>She hesitated, her eyes turned in
the direction of the house.</p>

<p>“Besides,” he added hastily, “I
was going to tell you what I know
about you.”</p>

<p>“Then,” she answered reluctantly,
“I’ll stay—a minute.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. And shall we be comfortable
during that minute? ‘Come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
let us sit upon the ground and tell sad
stories of the death of kings.’”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Please!” he begged. “You will
never be able to stand during all I
have to tell you. Besides, you forget
my delicate physique; I have been
repeatedly warned against over-exertion.”</p>

<p>She sank gracefully to the grass in
a billowing of white muslin, smiling
and frowning at once as though annoyed
by his persistence, yet too
amiable to refuse. All of which
produced its effect, Ethan realizing
that she was doing him a
great favor and becoming duly
grateful. He followed her example,
seating himself on the turf in front
of her, paying, however, less attention
to the disposition of his feet.
Unconsciously his hand sought a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
pocket, then dropped away again.
She laughed softly.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 600px;">

     alt="Ethan and Clytie on the bank" title="Ethan and Clytie on the bank" />
</div>

<p>“Please do,” she said.</p>

<p>“You’re sure you don’t mind?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” she answered. So he
produced his cigarette case and then
his match-box and finally blew a breath
of gray smoke toward the motionless
branches overhead.</p>

<p>“Feel better?” she asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Much, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Then you may begin.”</p>

<p>“Begin——?”</p>

<p>“Tell me what you know about
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! To be sure. Well, let me
see. In the first place, your name is
Laura Devereux. I am right?”</p>

<p>She smiled mockingly.</p>

<p>“I haven’t agreed to tell you that.”</p>

<p>“Oh! But I know I am. I haven’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
asked any questions, for that would
have been taking an unfair advantage,
I fancy. But I happened to overhear
yesterday afternoon at the Inn that a
family by the name of Devereux had
taken The Larches. And, as I have
been in Riverdell before, I know
where The Larches is—are—. Would
you say is or are?”</p>

<p>“I am only a listener.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall say am, to be on the
safe side; I know where The Larches
am. You are living at The Larches.”</p>

<p>“No, I—I am merely staying
there.”</p>

<p>“For the summer; exactly. That’s
what I meant. When you are at home
you live in Boston. I won’t tell you
how I discovered that, but it was quite
fairly.”</p>

<p>“Do I—are you sure I am a Bostonian?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hm! Now that you mention it—I
am not. Perhaps your family
moved to Boston from somewhere
else?”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“From—let me see! Pennsylvania?
But no, you don’t talk like a
Pennsylvanian. Maryland? No again.
Where, please?”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t acknowledged the
correctness of any of your premises
yet,” she objected.</p>

<p>“But you don’t dare tell me I’m
wrong,” he challenged.</p>

<p>“At least, I am not going to tell
you so,” she answered.</p>

<p>“That is as good as an admission!”</p>

<p>“Very well,” she replied serenely.
“And now that you know so much
about me—that is all, by the way?”</p>

<p>“So far,” he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then don’t you think I ought to
know something about you?”</p>

<p>“I am flattered that you care to.”
He laid a hand over his heart and
bowed profoundly.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_069.jpg" width="600" height="587"
     alt="Ethan" title="Ethan" />
</div>

<p>“My curiosity is of the idlest imaginable,”
she responded cruelly.</p>

<p>“I regret that bow,” he said.
“However, I shall tell you anyhow.
I am like the prestidigitateur in that I
have nothing to conceal. And,” he
added ruefully, “mighty little to reveal.
My name is Parmley, surnamed
Ethan. I am holding nothing back
there, for I have no middle name. It
has been a custom in our family since
the days of the disreputable old Norman
robber from whom we are descended
to exclude middle names. I
was born in this same Commonwealth
of Massachusetts of well-to-do and
honest parents, both of whom have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
been dead for some years. I was an
only child. Pray, Miss Devereux,
consider——”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind,” she interrupted,
“I’d rather you didn’t call
me that. I haven’t owned to it, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me! I was about to ask
you, Miss Clytie, to consider that fact
when weighing my faults. As a child
I was intensely interesting; I have
gathered as much from my mother. I
passed successfully through the
measles, mumps, scarlet fever and
whooping-cough. I also had the postage-stamp,
bird-egg and autograph
manias. Later I wriggled my way
through a preparatory school—a sort
of hot-house for tender young snobs—and
later managed, by the skin of
my teeth and a condition or two, to
enter college. As it has been the custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
for the Parmleys to go to Harvard,
I went there too. I am boring
you frightfully?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I succeeded in completing a four-year
course in five. Some chaps do
it in three, but I didn’t want to appear
arrogant. I took it leisurely and finished
in five. Then, as there had
never been a lawyer in the family, I
decided to study law. I entered the
Harvard Law School and graduated
a few weeks ago. I am now spending
a hard-earned vacation. In September
I am to enter a law firm in Providence
as a sort of dignified office-boy.</p>

<p>“I am the possessor of some worldly
wealth, not a great deal, but enough
for one of my simple tastes. I am even
a member of the landed gentry, since I
own a piece of land with a house on it.
I also own an automobile, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that I have to thank for this pleasant
meeting.”</p>

<p>She smiled a question.</p>

<p>“I left Boston bright and early
Monday morning with Farrell. Farrell
calls himself a chauffeur, in proof
of which he displays a license and a
badge. If it wasn’t for that license
and that badge I’d never suspect it.
Farrell’s principal duty seems to be
to hand me wrenches and screw-drivers
and things when I lie on my back
in the road and take a worm’s-eye
view of the machine. All went as nice
as you please until we reached a spot
some two miles north of this charming
hamlet. There things happened. I
won’t weary you with a detailed list
of the casualties. Suffice it to say that
I walked into Riverdell and Farrell
followed an hour later leaning luxuriously
back in the car and watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
that the tow-rope didn’t snap. I
ate a supplementary breakfast at the
Inn while Farrell entertained the
blacksmith, and then, having nothing
better to do, I dropped the canoe into
the water and paddled downstream.
Ever since I stole my first apple forbidden
territory has possessed an unholy
fascination for me, and that is
why, perhaps, I roamed up the brook
and stumbled, as it were, into Arcady.”</p>

</div>

<p>“What color is your machine?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Exceedingly blue.”</p>

<p>“And—isn’t it almost repaired?”</p>

<p>“Er—almost, yes.”</p>

<p>“It is taking a long while, seems
to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, its malady was grave. I
think it had tonsillitis, judging from
the sounds it made.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed? But it seemed to go very
well.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>

<p>“I said that it seemed to go very
well.”</p>

<p>“You have seen it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it passed the house yesterday
at about two o’clock.”</p>

<p>“There are a great many blue cars
in the world,” he defended.</p>

<p>“Has it returned yet?” she asked,
unheeding.</p>

<p>“No. The fact is, I was on my way
to Stillhaven to visit friends there, so
I sent the car on for them to use.
I have observed that, failing my presence,
the car does fairly well for my
friends.”</p>

<p>“What a pessimist! And you are
staying in Riverdell?”</p>

<p>“For a few days, yes; at the Roadside.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“Riverdell should feel flattered to
find that you prefer it to Stillhaven as
a summer resort.” She gathered her
skirts together with one hand and
started to rise. Ethan jumped to his
feet and enjoyed the intoxicating felicity
of feeling her hand in his.</p>

</div>

<p>“Thank you,” she murmured,
smoothing her gown. Then, with a
return of that provoking, mocking little
smile, “Would it be a terrible
blow to your vanity,” she asked, “if
I were to tell you that your guesses
are all wrong?”</p>

<p>“Terrible,” he answered anxiously.</p>

<p>“Then I won’t tell you,” she said
soothingly.</p>

<p>“But—but—they’re not wrong, are
they?”</p>

<p>“‘Where ignorance is bliss——’”
she murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I’d rather know! Tell me
the worst, please!”</p>

<p>She shook her head smilingly.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she said.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to let me see
you again?” he asked dolefully.
Again she shook her head.</p>

<p>“I have had the offer of a new
pool,” she said, “one with all modern
improvements, and I think I shall
move.”</p>

<p>“But—now, look here, it isn’t fair!
What am I to do? It’s evident you’ve
never spent a holiday in Riverdell, or
else you’d appreciate my plight.
There’s nothing to do save paddle
around on that idiotic little river.
And every time I’m afraid the water
will leak out when I’m not watching it
and leave me high and dry. If only
for charity, please let me come here
and see you now and then—just for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
moment! I’ll be very good, really;
I’ll even agree to stay in the canoe
and frizzle before your eyes!”</p>

<p>“You speak,” she answered perplexedly,
“as though I had invited
you to come to Riverdell, or at least as
though I were to blame for your remaining
here!”</p>

<p>He resisted the words that sprang
to his lips.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon then. I wouldn’t
for the world imply anything so absolutely
criminal. But I am here and I
am bored; and surely you haven’t so
many excitements, so many engagements
in the mornings but that you
can spend a few moments communing
with nature here at the pool? Of
course, I don’t recommend myself as
an excitement; perhaps I’m more of
a narcotic; but I’ll do anything in my
power to amuse you! I’ll—I’ll even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
tell you fairy stories or sing to you;
and I’ve never done either in my
life!”</p>

<p>“That is indeed an inducement
then,” she laughed. “But—good-bye.”</p>

<p>“You won’t?”</p>

<p>“Do you think it likely?” she
asked a trifle haughtily.</p>

<p>“Not when you look like that,” he
answered dismally.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she said again, moving
away.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” he answered.
His eyes were on the ground where
she had been sitting. He took a step
forward. From there he watched her
pass up the slope under the trees. At
the last she turned back and looked
regretfully at the pool shimmering in
the noontide heat.</p>

<p>“I shall be sorry to leave it,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
said softly, yet distinctly. “Perhaps—I
shall change my mind.”</p>

<p>Then she went on, passing from
shadow to sunlight, until the trees hid
her. When she was quite out of sight
Ethan lighted a cigarette, smiling the
while. Then he flicked aside the
charred match, lifted his left foot,
stooped and picked up a little white
wad which, as he gently shook it out,
became a dainty white handkerchief.
He looked at it, held it to his nose,
touched it to his lips, folded it carefully
and clumsily and placed it in his
pocket. Then he turned toward the
pool and the canoe.</p>

</div>

<p>“She’s a coquette,” he muttered,
“an arrant coquette. But—but she’s
simply—ripping!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">VI.</a></h2>
</div>


<p>Ethan finished his second cigarette
and tossed it hissing into the pool.
The nearest swan immediately paddled
over to investigate. Ethan
sighed exasperatedly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="600" height="244"
     alt="swan" title="swan" />
</div>

<p>“Go ahead, then, you old idiot!”
he muttered. “You won’t like it any
better than you liked the last one;
they’re out of the same box; but try
it if you want to. There, I told you
so! Oh, that’s it; blame me now!
Blessed if you aren’t almost human!”</p>

<p>He looked for the twentieth time
toward where the corner of the white
pergola gleamed through the trees
and for the twentieth time turned his
gaze disappointedly away again. He
had been there almost three-quarters
of an hour, and he wasn’t going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
stay another minute! If she didn’t
want to come, all right! Only she
wouldn’t get her handkerchief if she
didn’t! He had begun to doubt this
morning whether she had dropped
that article on purpose, as he had suspected
yesterday. If it had been an
accident she had probably returned already
and searched for it, and he
could not base his hopes of seeing her
on the score of the handkerchief. It
was quite evident, anyhow, that she
wasn’t coming. That farewell remark
of hers which he had translated to his
own liking meant nothing, after all.
He would throw his things into his
bag and go on to Stillhaven after dinner.
He had been a comical ass to fool
around here like this tagging after a
girl who didn’t want to be bothered
with him and risking dyspepsia at the
Inn! And what the deuce was he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
thinking about women for, anyway?
Hadn’t he taken a solemn vow on the
occasion of his first, last and only
affair to leave them severely alone?
He grinned reminiscently.</p>

<p>That had been a desperate affair,
brief and tragic. It had occurred in
his freshman year. <em>She</em> was a “saleslady”
in a florist’s shop on the Avenue.
She had cheeks like one of the
bridesmaid roses she sold, a tip-tilted
nose, sparkling gray eyes and a mass
of black hair which stood up from her
forehead in a mighty rolling billow
and smelled headily of violet perfume
when she pinned a carnation to his
coat. It had been love at first sight
with Ethan, and he had seldom appeared
in public without a flower in
his button-hole. He remembered with
something between a shudder and a
sigh the exaltation of pride and joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
with which he had accompanied her
to the theatre that first time! When
he had returned from his Christmas
vacation to find her engaged to the
red-haired drug-clerk on the next corner
he had promptly become a confirmed
misogynist. During the seven
years which had elapsed between that
time and this he had relented somewhat,
had gone through more than one
mild flirtation and had kept his heart.
There had been so many, many other
things to occupy him that love had
remained unconsidered. And now,
what was he doing here, sitting in a
canoe in a lily pond when he ought of
right to be at Stillhaven helping Vincent
sail the “Sea Lark” in the club
races? Wasn’t he making a fool of
himself again? Then something white
moved toward him between the trees
and the question went unanswered.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think I must have lost a handkerchief
here yesterday,” she announced
by way of greeting and explanation.</p>

<p>“A handkerchief?” he cried.
“Let me help you search.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t bother! It doesn’t
matter, of course, only—I
thought that if it was here I’d
get it.”</p>

<p>But Ethan was already out of the
canoe.</p>

<p>“Er—what was it like?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Rather plain, I think; just a narrow
lace edge.”</p>

<p>They looked diligently over the
grass. Plainly it was not there. She
raised her head, brushed a stray lock
of hair from her forehead and
laughed.</p>

<p>“I’m always losing them,” she said
apologetically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he suggested, “it
might be well to offer a reward.”</p>

<p>“A splendid idea!” she cried.
“We’ll post it on this tree here.
Have you a piece of paper? And a
pencil?”</p>

<p>“Both.” He tore the front from
an envelope and handed her his pencil.
She accepted them and set herself
down on the grass.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, what shall I write on?
The canoe paddle? Thanks. Now
let me see. What shall I say?”</p>

<p>“You must start by writing
‘Lost!’ in big letters at the top.
That’s it.” Ethan’s rôle of adviser
carried delicious privileges. It allowed
him to kneel quite close behind
her and observe the pink lobe of one
small ear from a position of disquieting
proximity.</p>

<p>“And then what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“I beg your pardon!” he said,
with a start. “Why, then—er—let
me see. ‘Lost’——”</p>

<p>“I have that,” she said demurely.</p>

<p>“A small handkerchief belonging——”</p>

<p>“How did you know it was small?”
she asked with smiling interest.</p>

<p>“They always are,” he answered.
“Where was I?”</p>

<p>“‘A small handkerchief belonging’——”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t sound quite shipshape.
Let’s try again. ‘Lost, a
small lady’s’——”</p>

<p>They laughed together as though it
was a most novel and excellent joke.</p>

<p>“I don’t care to advertise my
smallness,” she objected.</p>

<p>“Well, once more now. ‘Lost, a
small handkerchief with a funny little
lace border and an embroidered D in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the left-hand lower corner. Finder——’”</p>

<p>“An embroidered D?” she asked
puzzledly.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it a D?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was,” she allowed.
She leaned a little farther forward,
for the brief glance she had cast toward
him had revealed the fact that
his head was startlingly near. “And—and
the reward?” she asked a
trifle constrainedly.</p>

<p>“Finder may keep same for his
honesty!”</p>

<p>“But—but that’s ridiculous!” she
cried. “What’s the use of advertising
at all?”</p>

<p>“To save the finder from committing
theft,” he answered soberly.
“Think of his conscience!”</p>

<p>“How do you know it’s a ‘him’?”
she asked carelessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“I used the masculine gender merely
in a—er—general way.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Have you written that?”</p>

<p>“No, what’s the good of it? If the
finder is dishonest enough to keep it he
may look after his own conscience!”</p>

<p>“That’s unchristian,” he answered
sadly.</p>

<p>“I’ll do this, though,” she said.
“If the finder will produce it I will
allow him to keep it on one condition.”</p>

<p>“And that?” he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“If there is a D on it he may have
it. Otherwise——”</p>

<p>The finder produced it, unfolded it
and looked at the “left-hand lower
corner.”</p>

<p>“Well?” she asked, smilingly. He
frowned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“It—it looks more like an H,” he
answered.</p>

<p>“It is an H! Now may I have it?”</p>

<p>“But it ought to be a D,” he said.
“H stands neither for Devereux,
Laura, nor Clytie.”</p>

<p>“I never said it did!”</p>

<p>“This is quite plainly not your
property,” he went on, refolding it.
“Being unable to find the owner, I
shall retain possession of it.”</p>

<p>“But it’s mine!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Yours? What does the H stand
for, then?”</p>

<p>She hesitated and flushed.</p>

<p>“I never said my name was Laura
Devereux,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“No, but you see I happen to know
that it is.” He replaced the handkerchief
in his pocket. Then he
reached forward and took the paper
and envelope from her lap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
<a href="#i_frontis">“I shall write an advertisement myself,” he
said.</a></p>

<p>She watched him while he did so,
biting her lip in smiling vexation.
When it was done he passed the composition
across to her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noic">“FOUND!”</p>

<p>“A lady’s lace-bordered handkerchief bearing
the initial H in one corner. Owner may
recover same by proving ownership and rewarding
finder. Apply to Vertumnus, care
Clytie, Lotus Pool, Arcadia, between ten and
twelve.”</p></div>

<img src="images/i_089.jpg" width="600" height="376"
     alt="riverbank" title="riverbank" />
</div>

<p>“What’s the reward?” she asked.
He shook his head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I haven’t decided yet. Something—rather
nice, I fancy.”</p>

<p>A faint flush crept into her cheeks
and she turned her gaze toward the
pool.</p>

<p>“It is much cooler to-day,” she
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, last night’s thunder-storm
cleared the air,” he replied, in a similar
conversational tone. She glanced
at the tiny watch hanging at her belt.
Then she murmured something and
sprang lightly to her feet before
Ethan could go to her assistance.</p>

<p>“You are not going?” he asked
in dismay.</p>

<p>She nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“But it’s quite early!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it right to associate
with dishonesty,” she answered severely.
“You know very well that
that handkerchief is mine!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” he answered. “That
is, I saw you drop it yesterday. Probably
it belongs really to someone else.
Unless—” he smiled—“unless you
bought it at a bargain sale? In which
case the initial didn’t really matter, I
suppose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you give it to me?” she
asked unsmilingly.</p>

<p>“But it’s such a little thing!” he
pleaded earnestly. “You have so
many more that surely the loss of this
one won’t inconvenience you. And I—I’ve
taken a fancy to it.”</p>

<p>“That’s a convenient excuse for
theft!” she answered.</p>

<p>“It’s the only one I have to offer,”
he replied humbly.</p>

<p>“But—it’s so absurd!” she cried
impatiently. “What can you want
with it?”</p>

<p>He was silent a moment. She
glanced furtively at his face and then
moved a few steps toward the house.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you really want me to
tell you?” he mused.</p>

<p>“Tell me what?” she asked uneasily.</p>

<p>“Why I want to keep it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t think I am—especially interested,”
she answered coldly. “Are
you going to return it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe; in a moment. You don’t
want to hear the reason?”</p>

<p>“I—Oh, well, what is the reason?”
she asked impatiently.</p>

<p>“A very simple one. As a handkerchief
merely it doesn’t attract me
especially. I have seen more beautiful
ones, I think——”</p>

<p>“Well!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“My desire to keep it arises from
the simple fact that it is yours,
Clytie.”</p>

<p>She strove to meet his gaze with one
exhibiting the proper amount of
haughty resentment. But the attempt
was a failure. After the first glance
her eyes fell, the blood crept into
her face and she turned quickly
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“May I keep it, please?” he asked
softly.</p>

<p>She went swiftly up the little slope
under the trees.</p>

<p>“Clytie!” he called. She paused,
without turning, to listen.</p>

<p>“May I keep it?”</p>

<p>Clytie dropped her head and passed
quickly from sight.</p>

<p>Ethan stretched his arms, chastely
clad in striped blue and white madras,
yawned expansively, kicked his legs
loose from the sheet in which they
were entangled, and awoke; awoke to
find the sunlight dancing across the
room and making radiant blurs of his
brushes on the old mahogany bureau;
awoke to find a robin fervently launching
his brief ballad in through the
window from the branches just outside;
awoke to find himself in a new
and very wonderful world, a world
populated by a girl with violet eyes,
a reiterating robin, and himself!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 474px;">
<img src="images/i_095.jpg" width="474" height="600"
     alt="fireplace" title="fireplace" />
</div>

<p>He was in love!</p>

<p>Knowledge of the fact came to him
with a heart-clutching abruptness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
He had gone to sleep last night without
premonition; he awoke now to
a startling illumination of mind.
Whence had the tidings come? From
the dancing sunlight streaming across
the old boards? From the scented
breeze that stirred the leaves out
there? From the perfervid gossip of
the swelling throat? Who could tell?
And yet there it was, that knowledge,
as real as the green summer earth
awaiting him, as much a part of his
life as the breath he drew!</p>

<p>He lay for a long while with his
hands clasped under his head and
gazed out into the beautiful green and
golden and azure world, with a happy
smile on his face, thinking new and
ineffable thoughts. It is a glorious
thing to find oneself really, wholly in
love for the first time, glorious, wonderful,
absorbing....</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 201px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The robin ceased his pæan and was
silent, with his head cocked attentively.
Perhaps his ears were better than
yours or mine and he heard a song
sweeter and more triumphant than
any of his own, for after a moment of
listening he spread his wings and
floated down across sunlit spaces to
the orchard.</p>

<p>I wonder if the safety razor was not
invented for the man in love. Certain
it is that Ethan could never have used
any other sort this morning. At
times, driven by a mad impatience to
be out and away, he shaved frantically,
as though he feared that Nature
would roll up her landscape and be
gone ere he could reach it; at times
he stood motionless, gazing unseeingly
at the tip of his nose reflected in
the old mirror. Now he whistled
blithely, only to stop in the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of a note and relapse into a silent
gravity. In short, he exhibited all the
symptoms, mental and physical,
usually accompanying his disease;
temperature increased, pulse at once
full and fluttering, respiration erratic,
pupils of the eyes slightly dilated,
mind apparently affected.</p>

<p>He dressed with unusual care, bewailing
the fact that his choice of garments
was limited to two suits.
Neither blue serge nor gray homespun
seemed fitted for the occasion; his
heart hankered after purple and fine
linen. But at last he was dressed and
was hurrying down the creaking
staircase to a late breakfast. Forty
minutes later he was floating amidst
the lilies of Arcady.</p>

<p class="noic">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>That line of stars, dear reader, is
the typographic equivalent of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
wasted hours in the life of Ethan
Parmley,—three empty unhappy
hours spent in and about a silly old
puddle smelling like an apothecary
shop (I am using his own language
now) with only a trio of idiotic swans
to talk to. The Nymph of the Violet
Eyes came not.</p>

<p>And yet he saw her that day, after
all; caught a fleeting glimpse of her
that at once assuaged and sharpened
his hunger. He was on the porch of
the Inn after dinner smoking, morosely,
when a smart trap swept by
from the direction of The Larches. It
contained a coachman and two ladies.
One of the ladies had violet eyes,
though, as her head was turned away
from him and partly hidden by a
white parasol, he could not have
proved it at the moment. As for the
other, he couldn’t have said whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
she was young or old, fair or dark.
The pair of glistening, well-groomed
bays left Ethan scant time for observation.
In a twinkling the carriage
and its precious burden were gone.
And although he never left the porch
for more than a minute at a time all
the rest of that interminable summer
afternoon he found no reward. There
were other roads leading to The
Larches.</p>

<p>The evening mail brought him a
note from Vincent Graves:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Farrell showed up here Monday with the
car and your note. I tried to find out from
him what you were up to, but he either didn’t
know or exercised a discretion I never credited
him with. I hope it is nothing more than sunstroke;
folks have been known to recover from
that with their minds almost as good as new.
Anyhow, I am coming over in a few days to
see for myself. I know all about mythology—accent
on the <em>myth</em>. But look here, no poaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
on my preserves! I finished third yesterday
on time-allowance; would have done better
if I hadn’t carried away my jib at the outer
mark. No wind to speak of. Can’t you come
on for Saturday’s race? We’ve had the car out
once or twice. There’s something wrong with
it. Farrell has it in hospital to-day. My
compliments to her, but tell her I need you
here.</p>

<p class="noic">“Yours,</p>

<p class="right">“<i>Vincent</i>.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>After supper Ethan drew a chair
to the open window of his room, set
the lamp precariously on the bureau
where the light would fall upon the
portfolio in his lap, and replied to
Vincent:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My dear Vincent (he wrote), life moves
sweetly in Arcadia. Clytie, she who beside her
blossom-starred pool has so long gazed, enamored,
upon the fiery Apollo, now hearkens to
the wooing tones of green-garlanded Vertumnus.
No more she fills the leafy hollow with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
tears and soft reproaches, but reclined where
shading branches defy the sun god’s fiercest
rays, she smiles betimes upon Vertumnus. And
he, bathing his heart in the warm blue pools of
her eyes, forgets and forswears the too-coy Pomona.
So, friend, runs the drama of Clytie
the dawn-eyed Nymph of the Lotus Pool; of
Apollo, radiant and unapproachable Lord of the
Sun; and of Vertumnus, humble and enamored
God of the Seasons. Friend, for love of
me, petition fair Venus to aid my cause!</p>

<p>“And now Jove be with you! The night
wind steals sweetly through Arcadia’s moonlit
glades and bears to my nostrils the heart-stirring
fragrance of lily and of lotus. It is
Clytie’s breath upon my cheek. Ah, my friend,
I weep for you that you can never know the
love of a god for a nymph in Arcady! May
Somnus, gentlest of the gods, send thee sweet
dreams. Farewell.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Vertumnus.</span>”<br />
</p>

<p>“And now, having read this over, I see
clearly that it is beyond your understanding,
my friend, and so it may be that it will never
reach your eyes.”</p></div>

<p>It never did.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII.</a></h2>
</div>


<p>It sometimes rains even in Arcady.</p>

<p>When Ethan arose the next morning
he found that Apollo was taking a
rest and that Jupiter was having
things all his own way. At the foot
of the orchard the little river was
foaming and boiling with puny ferocity.
The grass was beaten and
drenched and the foliage was adrip.
But in the shelter of the elm outside
the window a robin chirped cheerfully,
thinking doubtless of gustatory joys
to come.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re taking it philosophically,
my friend,” muttered Ethan,
“and I might as well follow your
example, even though I have a soul
above fat worms. It’s got to stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
sometime, and I might as well make
the best of it meanwhile. Still,” he
added ruefully, “a whole day in this
ramshackle old ark doesn’t appeal to
me much.”</p>

<p>He dressed leisurely, ate breakfast
slowly, and afterward sought to kill
time with a book by a window in the
tap-room. The volume, a paper-clad
novel left by some former guest, answered
well enough. It is doubtful if
he could have given undivided attention
to the most engrossing story ever
written. The rain, streaking down
the tiny panes, caught strange hues
from the old glass and the light from
the crackling logs in the fire-place.
Sometimes they were green like tender
new apple leaves in May, sometimes
blue like rain-drenched violets,
like—no, not like but, rather, reminiscent
of, certain eyes! Ah, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
food for thought! The novel was
turned face-downward on his knee,
the cigarette drooped thoughtfully
from the corner of his mouth and his
hands went deep into his pockets.
Those eyes! Rain-drenched violets?
By jove, yes! No simile, no comparison
could be better! Rain-drenched
violets touched by the yellow light of
the sun stealing back through gray
clouds! Rather an elaborate description,
he thought with a smile at his
sentimentalism. The smile deepened
as he recalled the infinitesimal blue
circle under the left eye, a little blue
vein showing with charming distinctness
against the warm pallor of the
skin like a vein in soft-toned marble.
It was a little thing to recall, little in
all ways, but it seemed to him a veritable
triumph of the memory! By half
closing his eyes he could almost see it.</p>

<p><em>Slam!</em></p>

<p>The paper-covered novel fell to the
floor and lay fluttering its leaves in
helpless appeal. He rescued it and
sought his place again, smiling with
real amusement over his foolishness.</p>

<p>“I’m certainly behaving like an
idiot,” he thought. “I never knew
being in love was so—so deuced unsettling.
First thing I know, if I don’t
keep a pretty steady hand on the
reins, I’ll be writing poetry or roaming
around the place cutting hearts
and initials in the tree-trunks! H’m;
let me see now; where was I? Ah,
here we have it!</p>

<p>“‘Garrison laid the diamond
trinket gently back on the desk and
puffed slowly at his cigar. Presently
he turned with disconcerting abruptness
to Mrs. Staniford. “There is
no possibility of mistake?” he asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
“None,” was the firm reply. “You
could swear to the identity of this
jewel in court?” “Yes.” Garrison
whipped a small round, black object
from his pocket and settled it against
his eye. Then he took up the trinket
again and bent over it closely. “My
dear madam,” he said softly, “if you
did that you would be making a grave
mistake.” “What do you mean?”
she cried fiercely. “I mean,” was the
smiling response, “that this is not
one of your jewels,—unless——”
“Well?” she prompted impatiently.
“Unless, my dear madam, you wear
paste!” A sharp involuntary exclamation
of surprise startled them.
They turned quickly. Lord Burslem
was crossing the library with white,
set face.’</p>

<p>“Pshaw! I knew all along the
things were paste,” sighed Ethan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
“Singleton is Mrs. Staniford’s son by
a former marriage and she has
pinched the stones and given them to
him to get him out of a scrape, something
to do with that lachrymose Miss
Deene, maybe; at least, something she
knows about. Laurence is as innocent
as the untrodden snow, or whatever
the correct simile is, and if I keep
on to the last chapter I’ll find out that
fact. But I prefer to believe him
guilty. He wore a gardenia in his
buttonhole, and that settles it. I can’t
stand for a man who wears gardenias.
I insist that he is guilty.”</p>

<p>He tossed the book half-way across
the room, arose, stretched his long
arms above his head and stared out
of the window. The rain was falling
straight down from the dark sky in a
manner that would doubtless have
pleased Isaac Newton greatly, showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
as it did so perfectly the attraction
of gravitation. The drops were
of immense size, and when one struck
the window pane it spread itself out
into a very pool before it trickled
down to the sash. Ethan watched for
awhile, then yawned, glanced at his
watch and lounged in to dinner.</p>

<p>About three o’clock the sky lightened
somewhat and the torrential
downpour gave way to a quiet drizzle.
He donned a raincoat and sought the
road. It was not bad walking, for the
surface was well drained, and he had
put three-quarters of a mile behind
him before he had considered either
distance or destination. Then, looking
around and finding the highway
lined on the right by an ornamental
iron fence through which shrubs
thrust their wet leaves, he smiled and
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to come here,” he
said to himself, “but now that I’m
here I might as well go on and tantalize
myself with a look at the house.”</p>

<p>Another minute brought him to a
broad gate, flanked by high stone pillars.
A well-kept drive-way swept
curving back to a large white house,
a house a little too pretentious to entirely
please Ethan. On one side,—the
side, as he knew, nearest the lotus
pool,—an uncovered porch jutted out,
and from this steps led to a white pergola.
The latter was a recent addition
and as yet the grapevines had not succeeded
wholly in covering its nakedness.
From one of the windows on
the lower floor of the house a dull
orange glow emanated.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p>“They’ve got a fire there,” said
Ethan, “and she’s sitting in front of
it. Wish I was!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>He settled the collar of his raincoat
closer about his neck to keep out the
drops, and sighed.</p>

<p>“You know,” he went on then,
somewhat defiantly, addressing himself
apparently to the residence,
“there’s no reason why I shouldn’t
walk right up the drive, ring the bell
and ask for—for Mr. Devereux. I’ve
got the best excuse in the world. And
once inside it would be odd if I didn’t
see Her. I’ve half a mind to do
it! Only—perhaps she’d rather I
wouldn’t. And—I won’t.”</p>

<p>He took a final survey of the premises
and turned away with another
sigh. Before he had reached the Inn
the clouds had broken in the south and
a little wind was shaking the raindrops
from the leaves along the road.</p>

</div>

<p>“A good sailing breeze,” he
thought. “And, by the bye, this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Saturday. I ought to be at Stillhaven
helping Vin win that race. I suppose
I’ve disappointed him. However, a
fellow can’t be in two places at once;
he ought to know that.”</p>

<p>The little breeze had held all night,
and this morning the trees and shrubs
were quite dry again, but looking better
for their bath. It was Sunday,
and as the canoe floated into the harbor
of the lotus pool a distant church
bell was ringing. Perhaps, he told
himself with a sudden sinking of the
heart, he was doomed to another
day without sight of Clytie; for
it might be that the family would
drive to church. But the first
fair look about him dispelled his forebodings.
<a href="#i_112fp">She was</a> standing at the
border of the pool <a href="#i_112fp">throwing crumbs
of bread to the swans</a>. She saw him
at almost the same moment and smiled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_029_113.jpg" width="600" height="177"
     alt="more river" title="more river" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t come any nearer, please,”
she said. “You’ll scare them.”</p>

<p>He dipped his paddle obediently and
sat silent in the rocking craft until
the last crumb had been distributed
and she had brushed the crumbs from
her outstretched hands. Stooping, she
picked a book from the grass and
faced him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
<a id="i_112fp">
  <img src="images/i_112fp.jpg" width="460" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_113">SHE WAS THROWING CRUMBS OF BREAD TO THE SWANS.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“May I come ashore?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You are already trespassing
dreadfully,” she objected.</p>

<p>“‘In for a penny, in for a
pound,’” he replied, sending the
canoe forward. “‘Might as well be
hanged for a sheep as a lamb.’ And
if I could think of any other proverbs
applicable to the matter I’d
quote them.” He jumped out and
pulled the bow of the canoe onto the
turf.</p>

<p>“You won’t mind, however, if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
decline to stay and be hung with
you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I should mind
very much. In fact, I demand that
you remain and go bail for me in case
I’m apprehended.”</p>

<p>“I fear I couldn’t afford it,” she
answered.</p>

<p>“Doubtless your word would
serve,” he said. “Perhaps, if you
told them the excellent character I
bear, you might get me off scot-free.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t think I know enough
about your character.”</p>

<p>“There’s something in that,” he
allowed. “Perhaps you had better
observe me closely for the next hour
or two. One can learn a great deal
about another person’s character by
observation.”</p>

<p>“How can I do that if I go to
church?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“You can’t. That’s one reason
why you’re not going to church.”</p>

<p>“Oh! And—are there other
reasons?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better give a
few of them. I don’t think the first
one is especially convincing.”</p>

<p>“Well, another one is that I
haven’t seen you for three days.”</p>

<p>She shook her head gravely.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 447px;">
<img src="images/i_116.jpg" width="447" height="600"
     alt="Clytie" title="Clytie" />
</div>

<p>“Go on, please.”</p>

<p>“Not good enough? Well, then,
another reason is that you haven’t
seen me for three days.”</p>

<p>She laughed amusedly.</p>

<p>“Worse and worse,” she said.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you’d care much
for that argument,” he responded
cheerfully. “It was somewhat in the
nature of an experiment, you see. But
the real unanswerable reason is this:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
I have missed seeing you very much,
I have been very dull, you are naturally
kind-hearted and would not unnecessarily
cause pain or disappointment,
and I beg of you to give me a
few moments of your cheerful society!
Is that—better?”</p>

<p>“I don’t particularly care for it.”</p>

<p>“Miss Devereux——”</p>

<p>“What have I told you?” she
warned.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon! But—now, really,
please let me call you by a Christian
name! I—I’d like to graduate from
mythology.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would be proper
for you to call me by my Christian
name,” she answered demurely.</p>

<p>“A Christian name, I said,” he
answered patiently. “Tell me why
you don’t want me to address you as
Miss Devereux, please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because——” She stopped and
dropped her gaze. “We’ve never
been properly introduced, have we?”</p>

<p>“True! Allow me, pray! Miss
Devereux, may I present Mr. Parmley?
Mr. Parmley, Miss Devereux!”
He stepped forward, smiling politely
and murmuring his pleasure, and ere
she knew what was happening he was
shaking hands with her. “Awfully
glad to meet you, Miss Devereux!”
he assured her cordially.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 455px;">
<img src="images/i_118.jpg" width="455" height="600"
     alt="he was shaking hands with her" title="he was shaking hands with her" />
</div>

<p>She backed away, striving to draw
her hand from his, and laughing merrily.</p>

<p>“Is that what you call a proper introduction?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the best I could do under
the circumstances,” Ethan answered.
“Having no mutual acquaintances
handy, you see——”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think—you might let go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
now?” she asked, her laughter dying
down to a nervous smile.</p>

<p>“Let go?” he echoed questioningly.</p>

<p>“Please! You have my hand!”</p>

<p>He looked down at it in mild surprise;
then into her face.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the strangest thing? I
was never so surprised——!”</p>

<p>“But—Mr. Parmley, please let
go,” she begged.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that I still
have it?” He tried to seem at ease
and to speak carelessly, but his heart
was pounding as though striving to do
the Anvil Chorus all by itself, and his
voice wasn’t quite steady.</p>

<p>“I do,” she answered coldly, biting
her lip a little. A disk of red burned
in each cheek. Her eyes were fixed
on his imprisoning hand. “Besides,
you are hurting me,” she added, falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
back upon the fib which is a woman’s
last resource in such a quandary.
But he shook his head soberly.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but that’s impossible.
You will observe that my hand is quite
loose about yours. Accuse me of unlawful
detention, if you wish, but not
of cruelty.”</p>

<p>“But—but it is my hand,” she protested
faintly.</p>

<p>“Well, that is nothing to boast of,”
he replied smiling somewhat tremulously.
She had kept her eyes from
him all along and he was determined
to see them before he gave up. “Look
at mine; it’s twice as big!”</p>

<p>The brown lashes fluttered for an instant
and Ethan nerved himself for
the shock of looking into those violet
eyes. He didn’t know what was going
to happen, he assured himself in a
sudden delicious panic, and he didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
much care. Probably he would do
something awfully rude, something
that would frighten and anger her,
something for which she would never
forgive him! Perhaps the sudden
trembling of his hand about hers
warned her, for the lashes lay still
again. A moment of silence followed,
during which Ethan’s heart threatened
to choke him. Then all at once
the little warm hand ceased tugging
and lay limp and inert in his. She
turned her head and looked toward
the trees and the shade.</p>

<p>“If we are going to hold hands for
any length of time,” she remarked
coolly, “perhaps we had better sit
down and be comfortable.”</p>

<p>Ethan released her instantly, while
a wave of burning color swept across
his face. He felt terribly small and
ridiculous! He realized that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
taken it for granted that she had been
experiencing emotions similar to his
own, and instead of that she had been
only bored and—and exasperated!
He followed her laggingly up the
slope, savagely calling himself names
and meditating a retirement in such
order as was still possible. She
seated herself comfortably on the
grass with her back against the smooth
round trunk of a maple and patted
down her skirts. Then she glanced
up at him calmly.</p>

<p>“Do you realize,” she asked, “that
you have made me late for church?”</p>

<p>He was grateful for that ready
change of subject and piqued that she
should be so little disconcerted. His
own heart was still dancing.</p>

<p>“I am an humble instrument of
Providence,” he answered as lightly
as he could, dropping to the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
at a respectful distance from the tips
of her small shoes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 600px;">

     alt="Ethan and Clytie on the bank" title="Ethan and Clytie on the bank" />
</div>

<p>“That sounds a little sacrilegious,”
she said. “Besides—<em>humble</em>?”</p>

<p>“Humble, yes,” he answered. “I
can’t think of a better word, unless it
is ‘abashed.’”</p>

<p>“But why do you call yourself an
instrument of Providence? Because
you live there?”</p>

<p>“‘That sounds a little sacrilegious,’”
he quoted. “I meant that if
you had gone to church you would
have made yourself very warm and possibly
returned with a headache. I
have saved you from that.”</p>

<p>“Thank you! But of course if it
hadn’t been for the introduction I
couldn’t have stayed!”</p>

<p>“That is understood,” he responded
with becoming gravity. She smiled
across as though amused by some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
thought, and Ethan felt vaguely uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“It’s possible,” she said thoughtfully,
“that you might have found a
mutual acquaintance after all to perform
the ceremony for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dare say; one usually can if
one hunts long enough. It’s a common
enough process, and not especially difficult.
For instance, I ask, ‘You are
acquainted in Boston, Miss Dev—Miss
Unknown!’ You reply ‘Slightly, Mr.
Parmley.’ ‘Perhaps you know the
Smiths?’ ‘Smith, Smith? N—no, I
don’t think so. Are they friends of
the Joneses?’ ‘I dare say; I’ve
never met the Joneses. Come to think
of it, though, there were some Joneses
visiting the Robinsons at Nahant last
summer; he is a banker, I think; there
were two daughters and a son just entering
college,’ ‘Oh, were you at Nahant?’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
you inquire. ‘Then perhaps
you met the Browns there?’ ‘Yes.’
‘Really? Isn’t that jolly? Did you
know Gwendolin?’ ‘Well, rather!’
I reply in a tone insinuating that it
was rather desperate while it lasted.
‘Isn’t that odd?’ you exclaim. ‘Yes,
funny how small the world is, isn’t
it?’ I remark with startling originality.
Then we’re acquainted. Yes, it’s
simplicity itself.”</p>

<p>“It certainly sounds so!” she
laughed. “Let us try it!”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>She frowned intently for a moment,
then,</p>

<p>“Are you acquainted in Stillhaven,
Mr. Parmley?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” he answered, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Then perhaps you know the—the
Penniwells?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sorry to say I don’t,” he replied,
laughing.</p>

<p>“No? They live in the next house
to the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Hotel? Ah, I think I’ve met the
Hotels! Was there a son about my
age, with——”</p>

<p>“Don’t be absurd!” she laughed.
“We’ll never get on if you don’t go
by the rules.”</p>

<p>“I thought I was,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Let me see! Oh, yes, the
Graveses, do you know them?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; do you?” he answered
interestedly.</p>

<p>“I’ve met them.”</p>

<p>“Vincent is a great friend of
mine,” he said eagerly. “I was on
my way to visit them for a while when—when I
stopped here.”</p>

<p>“Really?” she cried. “How
small the world is, after all!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>They laughed together. Then,</p>

<p>“And you know Vin?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I—I’ve met him,” she replied.
Her tone hinted of embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Ethan thoughtfully.
Had he discovered the explanation of
Vincent’s puzzling warning? Was the
girl before him the “preserves” referred
to by his friend? Ethan’s
heart sank for a moment. Nonsense!
She had plainly implied that she knew
him only slightly, in which case she
didn’t belong any more to Vin than
to him. “You don’t know him
very well, then?” he questioned
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you a—well, just a weeny
bit inquisitive?” she asked smilingly.</p>

<p>“It may sound so,” he acknowledged,
“but, you see, it means a good
deal to me; it’s rather important.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_127.jpg" width="600" height="238"
     alt="swan" title="swan" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Important?” she repeated wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, you see——” But of course
he couldn’t explain why it was important.
So he floundered helplessly a
moment. “Yes—that is—well, they
are very good friends of mine, Vin especially,
and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, you feared perhaps I wasn’t
a proper person for them to know?”</p>

<p>“Good heaven, no!”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see——!”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you,” he said discouragedly.
“Really, I was only talking
nonsense. I—I thought that if
you knew them well, and I knew them
well, then we—we might know each
other well!”</p>

<p>She gazed at him sorrowfully a moment.
Then she shook her head disappointedly.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “no, that wasn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
at all what you meant. I suppose even
studying for the law has its effect.”</p>

<p>He laughed embarrassedly.</p>

<p>“May I see what you are reading?”
he asked.</p>

<p>She lifted the volume from her lap,
gravely took a folded handkerchief
from between the leaves where it had
been doing duty as a mark, and handed
him the book.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you can’t trust me,” he
laughed.</p>

<p>“So am I,” was the regretful response.
“It is terrible to have a
friend both a—a prevaricator and a—a—a——”</p>

<p>“Embezzler,” he suggested helpfully.
“Yes, it is bad. ‘Love Sonnets
from the Portuguese,’” he continued,
reading the title. “May I ask
if you were going to take this to
church with you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of it. I suppose,
like most men, you consider them silly
and sentimental,” she challenged.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“Sweet and sentimental, rather,”
he replied.</p>

<p>“You could hardly be expected to
care for them, I suppose,” she said.
“Your tastes, if I recollect aright,
run rather toward ‘The Ingoldsby
Legends’!”</p>

<p>“That is indeed unkind,” he murmured
sorrowfully. “No, I am very
fond of these, this one especially; if
it were not Sunday I would read it.”</p>

<p>“What has Sunday got to do with
it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Perhaps nothing,” was the reply.
“I dare say it is only my Puritanism
cropping out. You know we New
Englanders find it very difficult to
reconcile pleasure with religion. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
can fancy the ghost of my great-great-great-grandfather,
in sugar-loaf hat
and with beruffed neck, standing over
there in the shadows, holding his
hands aloft in holy horror at the sight
of me sitting here on Sunday morning
with a volume of love-poems in my
hands.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense!” she cried indignantly.
“Isn’t love just as holy
as—as anything? Isn’t——” She
stopped abruptly and Ethan, lifting
his head, found her gazing toward him
with something almost like horror in
her wide eyes.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he cried anxiously.</p>

<p>She shook her head and dropped her
gaze to the hands folded on her knees.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she said very quietly.
She laughed softly, uncertainly.
“Will you give me my book, please?”
she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course,” he answered, still
puzzled. Then, as he started to hand
it to her, it opened at the fly-leaf and
he drew it back. “Laura Frances
Devereux,” he read aloud. He smiled
quizzically as he returned the volume.</p>

<p>“That proves nothing,” she replied
defiantly. “I—I might have borrowed
it.”</p>

<p>“True, circumstantial evidence is
not absolutely conclusive, unless—unless
there is a good deal of it!”</p>

<p>“You may think what you choose,”
she answered lightly. She looked at
her watch and prepared to rise. This
time Ethan was ready. She gave him
her hand and he helped her to her feet.
The hand drew itself gently but determinedly
out of his and he let it go
without a struggle.</p>

<p>“Must you go?” he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded. Then she laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you only knew what trouble
I have getting here you’d appreciate——”
She broke off, reddening a little.</p>

<p>“I do appreciate,” he said earnestly.
“And I thank you very much for
your kindness this morning to a very
undeserving chap. I—do you know,
Miss Devereux, I came within an ace
of calling at The Larches yesterday
afternoon?”</p>

<p>She looked up quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I went for a walk in the afternoon
and found myself at the gate
over there. I could see that you had
a fire in the library and——”</p>

<p>“But how did you know it was the
library?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Why—er—wasn’t it? I supposed
it was. Anyhow, it looked dreadfully
tempting. I pictured you sitting in
front of it, and I very nearly paid a
call.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m glad you didn’t,” she
breathed.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because—why, you don’t know
me!”</p>

<p>“I should have asked for your
father and introduced myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly don’t lack assurance!”
she gasped.</p>

<p>“It would have been all right,” he
assured her cheerfully.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have found him,
though,” she said dryly.</p>

<p>“Then I would have asked for Mrs.
Devereux, and, failing her, Miss Devereux.
You see, yesterday I was a bit
desperate,” he added smilingly.</p>

<p>“Desperate! I should say foolhardy!”</p>

<p>“Why? Because I wanted to see
you? Look here, please; why
shouldn’t I call on you at the house?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
As I’ve told you, I’m fairly respectable.
And—and I want to see you—more
often! I suppose it sounds
dreadfully cheeky,” he went on softly,
“but I want you to like me, and it
doesn’t seem to me that I get a fair
show.”</p>

<p>The color came and went in her
cheeks and the violets were hidden
from him.</p>

<p>“It certainly does sound—cheeky,
as you call it,” she said after a moment,
rather unsteadily. “Considering
that you have seen me but four
times.”</p>

<p>“Five, if you please. Besides, I
don’t see that that matters. In fact,
I rather think the mischief was done
the first time!”</p>

<p>He captured her hand and for a moment
it only fluttered in his grasp.
Then it tried for liberty, but unsuccessfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
A moment passed, and,</p>

<p>“Are you making love to me, Mr.
Parmley?” she asked, with a little
amused laugh. It was like a cold
douche, but he resisted his first impulse
to release her.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 445px;">

     alt="Ethan shskes hands with Clytie" title="Ethan shskes hands with Clytie" />
</div>

<p>“Yes, I am,” he answered stoutly.
“That’s just what I’m doing! And
I’m going to keep on doing it until
I’m convinced that there’s no hope for
me. Please don’t struggle,” he continued,
capturing her other hand also.
“I’ll let you go in just a moment.
Maybe I’m behaving a good deal
like a bully, but I’m head-over-heels
in love with you, Laura, and——”</p>

<p>“No, no! Please!” she cried, with
a little catch in her voice.</p>

<p>“What—what have I done?” he
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“I—You mustn’t call me that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well, I won’t—yet. But I
think of you as Laura——”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to!”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll try not to,” he answered
gently. “But—couldn’t you make
me very happy by telling me that I’ve
got a chance with you, dear? Just the
ghost of a chance?”</p>

<p>The bowed head shook negatively.</p>

<p>“You won’t? Or—you can’t?”</p>

<p>“I—I won’t,” she whispered.</p>

<p>He uttered a cry and strove to draw
her toward him, but she resisted with
all her strength.</p>

<p>“Please! <em>Please!</em>” she gasped.</p>

<p>“I’ll—try not to,” he said ruefully.
“But I may call at the house?
You’ll let me do that, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I—suppose so,” she murmured
faintly.</p>

<p>“To-day?” he cried. “To-morrow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no! Wait, please; let me
think.” She raised a pair of troubled
eyes to his for an instant. “I must
see you again first. I have something
to tell you; something which may
make a difference. Perhaps—perhaps
you won’t want to see me again—then!”</p>

<p>He laughed disdainfully.</p>

<p>“Try me! And when will you tell
me this—this wonderful news? To-morrow
morning? Here?”</p>

<p>She nodded and strove to release
her hands. After a moment of indecision
he let them go. She stood before
him motionless an instant. Then
she raised her head slowly and he saw
that her eyes were wet. With an inarticulate
cry of pain and longing he
started forward, but she held a hand
against him.</p>

<p>“Please!” she said again, imploringly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
His outstretched arms dropped
to his sides. “If I shouldn’t come—to-morrow——”
she began.</p>

<p>“But you’ve promised!”</p>

<p>“I know.” She nodded assent.
“But—but if I shouldn’t——”</p>

<p>“But you will!” he cried. “I
shall be here, dear! Don’t fail me!
If you don’t come I’ll go to the
house!”</p>

<p>“Then I must,” she said with a little
smile. “And now——” <a href="#i_138fp">She went
to him and placed her hands on his
shoulders</a> and felt him tremble under
her touch. She raised her eyes, violets
darkened and dewy with unshed
tears, to his. “Will you do one thing
for me?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_139">SHE WENT TO HIM AND PLACED HER HANDS ON HIS SHOULDERS.</a></div>
</div>

<p>His eyes answered.</p>

<p>“Then, please,—” she dropped her
head in sudden shame—“kiss me
once—and let me go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>His arms closed about her hungrily,
but she held back.</p>

<p>“Promise!” she whispered
“Promise to let me go!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he groaned, “I promise.”</p>

<p>For an instant he was looking far,
far down into dim, wonderful violet
depths....</p>

</div>

<p>Then he was alone. He turned unseeingly
toward the canoe and trod
upon the book which lay forgotten on
the grass. Stooping, he rescued it and
dropped it into his pocket.</p>

<p>“I’m getting to be an awful thief!”
he murmured tremulously.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="X" id="X">X.</a></h2>
</div>


<p>A glorious golden afternoon, a scintillant
silvery night, and then—Dawn’s
pink finger-tips aquiver on
the edges of the hills and the bursting
forth of a new day to the exultant
overture of Nature’s orchestra.</p>

<p>Ethan looked forth from the open
window on to the most beautiful sight
given to the eyes of mortals,—the
fresh, sparkling morning world of
summer seen through the magnifying
lenses of love. The orchard was fresh
and vivid with the tender greens of
sun-shot leaves and grass, and dark
and cool with pools of pleasant
shadow. Dew-gems shimmered under
the caressing breeze and the tips of
the spreading, reaching branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
nodded and whispered together. Beyond,
the little silver-voiced river
laughed amongst its shallows and
flashed in the sunlight. From the
marshland came the happy gurgle of
a flock of red-winged blackbirds, while
fainter, yet sweet and clear, the light-hearted
tinkle of the bobolink floated
across from the rising meadows.
Sleek, well-conditioned robins balanced
amidst the apple-trees and sang
contentedly between groomings of
their red waistcoats. And louder,
clearer, gladder sang Ethan’s heart.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_141.jpg" width="250" height="600"
     alt="riverside" title="riverside" />
</div>

<p>Dear reader, have you ever been
young and in love on a summer morning?
Do you recollect how intoxicating
was the soft, sweet breeze that
entered through the open window?
How like liquid gold the sunshine
spread across the sill and dripped
upon the floor? How every bird-note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
was but a different rendering of the
one sweet name? How eager and impatient
you were to be out in the good
green world and how loth to cease
your dreaming long enough to dress?
What a vastly important thing was the
selection of a tie or a ribbon? I hope
that you remember these things if you
have forgotten all else!</p>

<p>The lotus pool never glowed more
brilliantly, never sparkled more radiantly
than it did this morning. It
was not difficult to imagine that those
floating cups held the colors into which
Nature dipped her brushes ere she
painted the summer flowers. The lazy,
luxury-loving swans were dozing in
the sunlight on their tiny island. The
cascade plashed and tinkled over moss
and stone. The fringing trees blew
welcome shade upon the grassy sides
of the little basin. And Ethan, lifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
his dripping paddle as the canoe rippled
its way across the mirror-like
surface, drew a deep breath of the
scented air and experienced a sudden
bewildering joy of life, an almost paganish
exultation. It seemed to him
this morning that the world and he
drew breath together.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 311px;">
<img src="images/i_042_143.jpg" width="311" height="600"
     alt="foliage" title="foliage" />
</div>

<p>It was early when he floated into
Arcady and there were no violet eyes
to greet him. But his impatience was
soothed by the happiness which remembrance
gave him. He dreamed
there in the sunshine, lighting a cigarette
now and then and letting it burn
itself out unnoticed between his fingers.
White clouds floated across the
blue sky and across the surface of the
pool. Dragon-flies, their metallic-lustred
wings ablaze, darted and
turned. Birds sang and insects
buzzed, the breeze gossiped to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
leaves and the moments passed.
When he finally awoke fully from his
dreaming and looked wonderingly at
his watch the morning was almost
gone. He turned disappointed eyes
toward the brief vista afforded by the
jealous trees. No glimpse of white
drapery rewarded him. She had said
that she might not come. Why?
Vaguely troubled, he propelled the
canoe to the bank and stepped out.
Under the shade of the willow made
forever sacred by their meetings he
threw himself down and waited while
the long hand of his watch crept laggingly
half-way around the dial. But
patience had flown, and when the time
he had set himself had passed he
jumped to his feet and set off up the
lawn under the trees.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_017_144.jpg" width="600" height="312"
     alt="Ethan in the pool" title="Ethan in the pool" />
</div>

<p>Presently the corner of the white
pergola sprang into view. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
trees thinned away and he was looking
across an open, sun-bathed stretch
of lawn at the gleaming house. And
as he looked, himself a scarcely noticeable
figure against the green shadows
of the grove, the front veranda of the
house became suddenly peopled with a
girl in a white frock and a man in gray
flannels. They came together through
the doorway and paused side by side
at the top of the steps. Even at that
distance Ethan recognized them only
too well. The man had taken the
girl’s hand and was speaking to
her. Ethan watched for an instant
only, yet in that instant he saw with
a sudden sinking of the heart how the
girl’s head, the sunlight aglint on the
brown hair, lifted itself with a little
gesture of intimate happiness to her
companion. Then, in a sickening
panic lest he might see more, Ethan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
turned quickly and plunged back into
the shadows.</p>

<p>All the way back to the Inn, with
every stroke and lift of the paddle,
a refrain hammered ceaselessly at his
brain: “No poaching on my preserves!
No poaching on my preserves!”
What an ass he had been
not to understand! He hated Vincent
as he had never hated anyone in his
life, realizing all the while the absolute
injustice of it. Why hadn’t he
guessed from Vincent’s note how the
land lay? He might have known that
Vincent could have referred to no one
but Her. But why couldn’t the fool
have come out honestly and told him?
A week ago, even three days ago
would have been time! Then, in the
next moment, he knew that that was
not so, that it had always been too
late, always since that first meeting!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Yet why, if she were Vincent’s, had
she allowed him to love her? Why
had she virtually acknowledged her
love for him? Why——</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_147.jpg" width="600" height="397"
     alt="Ethan in a rowboat" title="Ethan in a rowboat" />
</div>

<p>He remembered that kiss with a
sudden choking, clutching sensation at
his throat. Had she meant nothing
by that? Nothing? No, she had
meant all, everything that he had
hoped! She did love him, and neither
Vincent Graves nor anyone else could
have her! But that exultation was
short-lived. What she had meant was
of little moment; she belonged to Vincent
by promise if by naught else, and
Vincent was his friend.</p>

<p>Things were suddenly greatly simplified.
His tangled thoughts smoothed
themselves out and he gave a sigh
that was partly of relief. At least
his duty was plain. “No poaching
on my preserves!” He had only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
heed that warning and take himself
out of the way. That thought steadied
him down and his pulses ceased their
deafening pounding. It wouldn’t be
easy, that duty! He knew that well
enough, although at this moment he
was viewing it almost calmly. When
the present excitement passed he
would find it hard going!</p>

<p>The prospect of facing Vincent
troubled him more than anything else
as he drew the canoe from the water
and laid it on its rack under the trees.
Vincent was probably even now awaiting
him up there on the porch. For a
moment he thought of taking the canoe
again and stealing off up the stream
for a ways and then walking across to
the station and taking the train for—anywhere
out of all this! But it would
be a sneaking, cowardly thing to do.
Besides, sooner or later Vincent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
he must meet, and as well now as any
time. He lighted a cigarette with
fingers that trembled a little and
walked up through the orchard.</p>

<p>As he had expected, Vincent Graves
was awaiting him on the porch. He
was a tall, dark, fine-looking fellow,
with a deep, pleasant voice and a remarkable,
careless ease of manner;
just the sort of a chap, Ethan told
himself, that any sensible girl would
fall in love with. Vincent did not see
him for a moment, and in that moment
Ethan had opportunity to study his
friend with a new interest, view him
from a novel point. But he found he
could not be coldly critical; Vincent
was Vincent, wholly admirable and
lovable; and Ethan’s heart warmed
under a sudden inrush of affection as
he went forward with outstretched
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello, Vin!” he said.</p>

<p>Vincent swung about, seized the
hand and grasped it warmly.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_151.jpg" width="600" height="595"
     alt="Ethan" title="Ethan" />
</div>

<p>“Why, you old chump!” he responded,
smiling broadly. “Aren’t
you ashamed to look me in the eye?
What have you been doing with yourself?
How’s mythology?”</p>

<p>“When did you come up?” asked
Ethan, echoing the smile.</p>

<p>“This morning. Stopped at——”
He looked at Ethan with a quick lowering
of the eyebrows. “Look here,
what’s the matter with you? You
have the cheerful, care-free countenance
of a gentleman strolling to the
gallows! Been ill?”</p>

<p>“Ill?” laughed Ethan. “Certainly
not; never felt better in my
life.”</p>

<p>“If you felt any better you’d
scream, eh? Well, you’ve been up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
something, Ethan, and you can lie
yourself black in the face for all I
care. You’re going back with me this
evening; that’s settled. I came over
in your machine and for a wonder it
didn’t even spring a leak. I left it
at The Larches,” he went on in response
to Ethan’s questioning survey
of the driveway and stable-yard. “I
stopped there and made a call.” He
paused, smiling mysteriously.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Ethan.</p>

<p>“Yes, I—look here, let’s take a
walk. What time is it? What? Oh,
dinner be blowed! Come on, I want
to talk a bit. Hang it, Eth, I’ll have
to talk or bust up like one of your
tires!”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Ethan, without
enthusiasm. “Smoke?”</p>

<p>Vincent accepted a cigarette and
when they had lighted up they passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
down the steps and along the road,
under the arching elms, Vincent’s
hand on his friend’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“It’s largely your fault, old chap,”
he said presently. He chuckled to
himself a moment before continuing.
“You see, I got uneasy about your
sudden and mysterious affection for
this rural paradise. I’ve never heard
you enthuse about it before; in fact I
remember several violently disparaging
remarks on the subject of Riverdell.
So when you wrote that you
were stopping here a while to study
mythology I got scared. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly! What are you jawing
about?”</p>

<p>“Lord, you’re dense! I’ll explain
in words of one——”</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 485px;">
<img src="images/i_153.jpg" width="485" height="600"
     alt="NO TRESPASSING" title="NO TRESPASSING" />
</div>

<p>“You see, Eth, you’re a very captivating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
beggar; you have a wonderful
way with the fair sex. For instance,
there was that girl at college——”</p>

<p>“Cut it out,” growled Ethan.</p>

<p>“Still touchy? Well, I wasn’t taking
any chances. Being interested
over this way myself I thought I’d better
take a run over and look after
things. Thought maybe you were
making love to my girl; poaching, you
know. Couldn’t have blamed you, old
chap, for she’s just about the swellest
thing you ever saw.”</p>

<p>“So you came up to head me off,
eh?” inquired Ethan uninterestedly.</p>

<p>“Exactly. And found to my surprise
that you hadn’t been near the
honey. You don’t know what you’ve
missed, Eth. They’re awfully nice
folks, the whole push; and they’d
have been tickled to death to have you
call. Why didn’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Consideration for your future
happiness, Vin,” answered the other
calmly.</p>

<p>“And you haven’t been near the
place?”</p>

<p>“I got as far as the gate one day
when taking a walk.”</p>

<p>“Well, will you tell me what in
blazes you’ve been doing here for the
last week?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Vincent studied him silently a moment.</p>

<p>“All right, old chap; I don’t want
to be rudely inquisitive.”</p>

<p>“You’re not; only don’t bother
your head about me. I’m off to-day,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re coming with me. The
mater made me swear by the graves
of my ancestors that I’d fetch you back.
And I’ve also promised to bring you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to dinner to-night at the Devereuxs’.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, Vin.”</p>

<p>“You won’t?”</p>

<p>“You’ve guessed it.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Look here, I want you
to meet Laura!”</p>

<p>Ethan winced.</p>

<p>“That’s nice of you, Vin, but really
I can’t. I’ve simply got to be in Boston
this evening. Tell them, please,
that I’m very sorry, will you? And
that I hope to have the pleasure some
other time. Make it all right, like a
good chap.”</p>

<p>“Well. But you’re coming over to
Stillhaven later, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Maybe; perhaps in a week or
two.”</p>

<p>“That’s rotten! Look here, Eth,
can’t I get in on this? I don’t know
what’s up, and I won’t ask, but if I
can help you any way——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course, old man. If you could
I’d say so. But there isn’t anything
wrong. I’ll explain later. It’s all
right.”</p>

<p>“Doubt it. But you know best, I
dare say.”</p>

<p>They turned by mutual consent and
strolled back toward the Inn. Presently
Vincent broke the silence again.</p>

<p>“By the way, I haven’t told you
quite all, Eth; I’m engaged.”</p>

<p>“The deuce you are!” Ethan simulated
intense surprise.</p>

<p>“Yep!” Vincent grinned triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Who to, you idiot?”</p>

<p>“Why, haven’t I told you? To
Laura Devereux. They’re the folks
I’ve been talking about. They have
The Larches. You knew that!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but—when did it happen?”</p>

<p>“About an hour or so ago. I didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
mean to do it to-day, but—hang it,
Eth, I just simply had to! She’s the
best girl in the world, old chap, and
the prettiest too. I want you to see
her. When you do you’ll understand.
I told her about you and she wants me
to bring you up to-night.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll be mighty happy,
Vin.” They shook hands there in the
empty road very gravely in spite of
their smiling faces. “And congratulate
her, too, old man. You’re rather
a good sort—at times. And of course
I’ll get you to take me to see her just
as soon as I come back. I’ll have to
get on the good side of her so she’ll
let me come and see you once in a
while when you’re married. When’s
it to be?”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_158.jpg" width="600" height="591"
     alt="the lane" title="the lane" />
</div>

<p>“Don’t be an ass!” grunted Vincent.
“As for when, well, we haven’t
settled that yet. Maybe it won’t be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
until Spring; I fancy she would
rather wait until then. And I ought
to get things fixed up a bit first, too,”
he added vaguely.</p>

<p>“Oh, it won’t take you long to burn
a few letters and photographs,” answered
Ethan flippantly.</p>

<p>“Go to the deuce! Do we eat
now?”</p>

<p>After dinner they sat together on
the porch until such time as Vincent
thought he might venture to return
to The Larches, and Ethan listened
patiently and with attempted enthusiasm
to his friend’s mild ravings.
Vincent was ludicrously happy.</p>

<p>“It’s all so darned funny!” he
kept repeating. “A few hours ago I
was scared to death for fear she
wouldn’t have me, and now——”</p>

<p>“And now you’re a goner,” finished
Ethan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Laugh if you want to,” replied
Vincent happily. “I expected you
would. I thought you’d cut up worse
than you have, old chap. My time
will come!”</p>

<p>“When it does, you let me know,”
scoffed Ethan.</p>

<p>“Look here, I wish you’d give up
this Boston business and go along with
me to-night, Eth. I—there’s a
reason.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, you’re beyond reason.
Besides, I can’t give it up, Vin.
Sorry; wish I could.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go to blazes! You could if
you wanted to. Look here, I lay you
any odds you like that you’ve been
caught yourself! You’ve met some
girl here and she’s gone home and
you’re tagging after! You ought to
have more pride, Eth!”</p>

<p>“I dare say, Mr. Solomon. By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
way, I don’t want to hurry you, but
it’s nearly half after two, and——”</p>

<p>“The deuce it is!” Vincent leaped
to his feet and Ethan laughed loudly
and cruelly. Vincent viewed him in
amazement a moment and then joined.</p>

<p>“Talk about tagging!” chuckled
Ethan.</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen her, you old
scoffer,” responded his friend.</p>

<p>At a little after three Ethan tossed
his luggage into the car, climbed in
beside the unruffled Farrell and swung
the big blue monster toward Boston.
And while it ate up the long miles
Ethan, his hands on the wheel, scowled
miserably ahead and honestly strove
to forget that he had ever stumbled
into Arcady.</p>

</div>


<p>A few days later Ethan walked into
the office of the law firm in Providence,
hung his hat on a hook in the closet
and blandly inquired for his desk.
The members of the firm discussed it
later in the privacy of the inner office.</p>

<p>“Looks as though he might be in
earnest, anyway,” suggested the
senior. “Apparently not afraid of
work, eh?”</p>

<p>“Something funny about it,” replied
the junior, who was a bit of a
pessimist. “It isn’t like a fellow of
his sort to give up his summer and
buckle down to reading law in July.”
He shook his head with misgivings.
“It won’t last, mark my word.”</p>

<p>But it did. Business was slack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
throughout the hot weather and Ethan
had plenty of time for reading; and
he made the most of it. Several letters
came from Vincent reminding him
of his promise and urging him to come
down to Stillhaven for a while. But
always Ethan pleaded press of duties,
until Vincent, whose own law shingle
had been hanging out for a year and
who had yet to find business pressing,
felt more convinced than ever that his
friend had, to use his own expression,
“come a cropper somehow!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_079_162.jpg" width="600" height="187"
     alt="the pool" title="the pool" />
</div>

<p>In September Vincent ran down and
spent Sunday. Ethan didn’t press
him to come again, for his conversation
was not of a sort calculated to
reconcile a disappointed lover to his
lot. The Devereuxs were still at
Riverdell, but were returning to their
Boston apartments the last of the
month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“She hasn’t forgiven you for not
calling,” warned Vincent, “and you’ll
have to eat dirt when you do see her,
old chap.”</p>

<p>Ethan expressed entire willingness
to grovel, but flatly refused to set a
date for the proceedings. Vincent
departed somewhat huffed, and for
some time there was a perceptible
coolness between them. Ethan regretted
it, but he wasn’t ready yet
to trust himself in the rôle of Vincent’s
friend.</p>

<p>His first vacation since he had gone
to work came early in October. Then
a letter from a real estate agent who
had the renting of his property made
a journey to Riverdell advisable. He
left Providence, with Farrell, in the
car one Friday morning, intending to
stay in Riverdell over Saturday, and
at two o’clock swung the machine in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
through the big gate of The Larches.
It had been a glorious brisk day, they
had made record time and Ethan’s
spirits had been high. But now, as
they rumbled slowly up the circling
driveway, old memories were asserting
themselves and buoyancy gave
place to depression. The maples were
aflame in the afternoon sunlight, the
Virginia creeper about the porches
was radiantly crimson, and along the
gleaming white pergola bunches of
purple grapes were still aglow. But
for all this The Larches had a lonesome
look. The windows on the lower
floor were shuttered and told eloquently
of desertion.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="600" height="474"
     alt="a well-kept driveway" title="a well-kept driveway" />
</div>

<p>Ethan’s summons at the bell went
unanswered for a time. Then footsteps
sounded on the marble tiles
inside and the big door swung open,
revealing a comfortably stout, double-chinned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
woman who wiped her damp,
red hands on her blue calico apron.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Ethan!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s I, Mrs. Billings,” he replied.
“Farrell, take the car around
to the stable and I’ll have William
open up for you.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 186px;">
<img src="images/i_166.jpg" width="186" height="600"
     alt="big blue touring car" title="big blue touring car" />
</div>

<p>He stepped into the dimly lighted
hall, already filled with the chill of approaching
winter, and looked about
him. Everything was apparently the
same in spite of its recent occupancy.
The house had been rented furnished,
and plainly the Devereuxs had been
satisfied to leave things as they had
found them. He took off his coat and
tossed it on to the big old-fashioned
mahogany couch. Mrs. Billings, the
housekeeper, was still chattering
volubly.</p>

<p>“If we’d known you was coming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
sir, we’d have had the blinds open and
the fires lighted.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” answered Ethan.
“Have your husband build a fire in
the library and in my room. I shan’t
be here beyond Sunday morning.
You can give me my meals in the
library. I had a letter from Stearns
a day or so ago telling me that the
Devereuxs had left and asking
whether I wanted to rent for the winter.
I don’t believe I do. I don’t
think I shall rent again at all.
Well how have you been, you and
that good-for-nothing husband of
yours?”</p>

<p>“Nicely, sir, for myself, thank you.
And Jonas, he isn’t one of the complaining
sort, sir, but he do have the
rheumatism something awful in wet
weather. And how has your health
been, Mr. Ethan?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve been frightfully healthy,
thank you. Where’s your husband?”</p>

<p>“I’ll call him, sir, at once. He’s
out somewheres on the grounds, sir.
And I’ll have a fire lit in no time, sir.
He’ll be very pleased to see you, sir,
will Jonas.” She stopped at the end
of the hall and sank her voice to a
hoarse whisper. “I fear he’s getting
old and failing, Mr. Ethan,” she said
despondently. “It—it’s his head sir.”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Along in June it was,
Mr. Ethan, or maybe early in the
month following, sir, that he came in
quite excited like and wild, saying as
he had seen you with his own eyes
over toward the grove there. Yes, sir.
‘Jonas,’ says I, ‘it’s the sun.’ ‘No,
’taint,’ says he. ‘I saw him with
my own eyes,’ says he, ‘a-standing
under the trees. And when I looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
again he was gone,’ he says. It gave
me quite a shock, sir, as you might
say.”</p>

<div class="figrighttop" style="width: 135px;">

<img src="images/i_169bottom.jpg" width="341" height="134"
     alt="lakeside" title="lakeside" />
</div>

<p>“Naturally. And since then you
have observed no other symptoms?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not particular, but he do
seem a heap fonder of his victuals
than he used to, and I’ve heard tell as
that’s a sure sign of a failing intellect,
Mr. Ethan.”</p>

<p>“In the case of your victuals, Mrs.
Billings,” replied Ethan, “I’d say it
was an indication of wisdom.”</p>

<p>The housekeeper bridled and
beamed.</p>

<p>“But, really,” continued Ethan,
smiling, “I wouldn’t worry about
Billings. The fact is, I was down
here for a day or so about the time
you speak of.”</p>

<p>“Here, sir? And you never came
to see us, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“There—er—there were reasons,
Mrs. Billings. And now how about
that fire? And send your husband out
to unlock the carriage house, please.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, directly, sir. And Jonas
really saw you, Mr. Ethan, same as
he said he did?”</p>

<p>“I think it more than likely, Mrs.
Billings.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a great load off my
mind, sir. Softening of the brain do
be so unfortunate!”</p>

<p>Later, just at dusk, Ethan emerged
from the library on to the broad
cement-paved porch at the side of the
house. Pausing to light a cigarette,
he passed down the stone steps to the
pergola and traversed its length.
Fallen leaves rustled softly under his
feet and the purple clusters showed
the effects of the frost. Once out of
the arbor, his steps led him almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
unconsciously across the open lawn,
russet now and streaked with the long
sombre shadows of the trees. He
found himself swayed by two desires;
one to see the lotus pool again, the
other to avoid it. He went on through
the twilight grove, filled with a gentle—I
had almost said pleasant—sadness.
Underfoot the ground was carpeted
with the red leaves of the
maples. Here and there a white birch
stood like a pale gold flame in the
dying sunlight. The dark green
larches alone held themselves unchanged.</p>

<p>The pool was sadly different. Yellowing
lily-pads floated upon the surface,
but no blossoms caught the slanting
rays of the sun. Ethan sat down
under the willow, took his knees into
his arms and puffed blue smoke-wreaths
into the amber light. Presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a shadow presence came and sat
beside him. The presence had violet
eyes and red, red lips that smiled wistfully.
He didn’t turn his head, for he
knew that if he did he would find himself
again alone. And presently they
talked.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 244px;">
<img src="images/i_172.jpg" width="244" height="600"
     alt="Clytie" title="Clytie" />
</div>

<p>“You were very cruel,” he said
sadly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to be,” she answered.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think you did. You—you
just didn’t think, I suppose.
It was all a bit of good fun with
you. But—it played the deuce with
me.”</p>

<p>“Did it?” she asked regretfully.</p>

<p>“But I’m not blaming you—now,”
he went on. “I did at first. It
seemed needlessly cruel and heartless.
But I understand now that it was all
my fault. You see, dear, I took it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
granted, I thought, that you—cared—the
way I did. It was my silly conceit.”</p>

<p>He thought he heard a little sob beside
him, but he resisted the temptation
to turn and look.</p>

<p>“If only there hadn’t been that
kiss,” he continued dreamily. “That—I’ve
never quite understood that.
Sometimes—I dare say it’s my conceit
again—but sometimes I can’t help
thinking that you did care—a little—just
then! That is the hardest to forgive,
dear,—and forget, that kiss. If
it wasn’t for the memory of that I
think I could stand it better. Why
did you do it? <em>Why?</em>”</p>

<p>There was no answer save the sighing
of a little breeze which crept down
the slope in a floating shower of dead
leaves.</p>

<p>“Ah, but I want to know!” he insisted
doggedly. “Was it just in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
fun? Was it merely in pity? It
couldn’t have been, I tell you! You
never kissed me like that for pity,
dear! There was love in your eyes,
sweetheart; I saw it; fathoms deep in
that purple twilight! Love, do you
hear? You can’t deny it, you can’t!
And you trembled in my arms! Why
did you do it?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>He turned impetuously,—and
sighed. He was all alone. The presence
had fled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="600" height="179"
     alt="the pool" title="the pool" />
</div>

<p>He tossed aside the dead cigarette
in his hand and shivered. The breeze
was growing as the day passed, a chill
October breeze laden with the heavy,
melancholy aroma of dying leaves.
He arose and retraced his steps to
the house.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XII" id="XII">XII.</a></h2>
</div>


<p>Ethan drank the last drop of excellent
black coffee in the tiny cup and
swung his chair about so that he faced
the cheerfully crackling logs in the
library fire-place. He had enjoyed his
dinner, and he began to feel delightfully
restful and drowsy. The day
spent in the open air, with the wind
rushing past him, the hearty repast
and now the dancing flames were all
having their natural effect. He
reached lazily for his cigarette case,
his gaze travelling idly over the high
mantel above him. Then his hand had
dropped from his pocket and he was
on his feet, peering intently at a small
photograph tucked half out of sight
behind one of the old Liverpool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
pitchers which flanked the clock. A
moment after he had it in his hands
and was bending over it in the glare
of the light from the chandelier.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 136px;">
<img src="images/i_026_175.jpg" width="136" height="600"
     alt="brass candlestick" title="brass candlestick" />
</div>

<p>It was evidently an amateur production,
but it was good for all that.
And Ethan was troubling his head not
at all as to its origin or its merits or
defects. It was sufficient for him that
it showed a small, graceful figure in
white against a background of foliage,
and that the eyes which looked
straight into his from under the waving
hair with its golden fillet were
Hers. It was Clytie. One hand rested
softly on a flower-clustered spray of
azalea, one bare sandaled foot
gleamed forth from under the straight
white folds of the peplum and the
lips were parted in a little startled
smile. Ethan devoured it eagerly
while his heart glowed and ached at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
once. He remembered telling her that
he would like to see those pictures,
and remembered her laughing response:
“I’m afraid you never will!”
And now he was looking at one of
them after all! And he was still looking
when the gardener entered with
the replenished wood-basket.</p>

<p>“Where did this come from, Billings?”
Ethan asked carelessly.</p>

<p>Billings set down his burden and
crossed to the table. He was a small
man, well toward sixty, with his
weather-beaten face shrivelled into
innumerable tiny, kindly wrinkles.
In spite of his years, however, he
showed no signs of the mental degeneration
which his wife had feared.
He came and looked near-sightedly at
the card which Ethan held out.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, Lizzie came across that
in one of the upstair rooms when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
was cleaning up after the folks went
away and she put it on the mantel
here, thinking maybe it was valuable
and they’d send back for it.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Ethan laid it on the table,
his eyes still upon it. “I don’t think
they’ll want it. Doubtless Miss Devereux
has plenty more.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; they took a good many,
sir, between them.”</p>

<p>“They? Oh, she had a friend with
her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Miss Hoyt. I remember
when they was taking those, sir. It
was early in the summer, soon after
they came. The young ladies they
dressed themselves up in those queer
things—sort o’ like sheets, they was,
sir—” the gardener’s voice became
faintly apologetic, as though he had
not quite approved of such doings—“and
went out on the lawn one forenoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
They got me to cut away a bit
of the branches, sir, right here.”
Billings indicated the upper left-hand
corner of the picture. “She said she
had to have more light. It wasn’t
much, sir; just a few old twigs; no
harm done, sir.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. It was—Miss
Devereux asked you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; Miss Laura they called
her. A very pleasant young lady,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Very pleasant, Billings,” assented
Ethan with a sigh.</p>

<p>“You know her, then, sir?”</p>

<p>“I—hardly that; I’ve met her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Billings turned toward
the fire. “Shall I drop another
log on, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, I shall be going to bed very
shortly.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.” Billings mended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the fire, replaced the tongs and stood
carefully erect again, chuckling reminiscently.
Then finding Ethan’s eyes
on him questioningly he said: “she
took me, sir, too, with her camery.”</p>

<p>“Really? I should like to see the
picture.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. It’s in the
kitchen. Shall I fetch it? Lizzie says
it’s a very speakin’ likeness, sir, excepting
that I was sort o’ took by surprise,
so to say, and had no time to
spruce up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, bring it in by all means.”</p>

<p>The gardener hurried away and
Ethan turned again to the picture.
When Billings returned Ethan said
carelessly:</p>

<p>“By the way, if your wife asks
about this you can tell her I have—er—taken
charge of it. Ah, this is the
picture, eh? Why, I’d call that excellent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Billings, excellent! Truly, a
very speaking likeness. You say Miss
Devereux took this?”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 441px;">
<img src="images/i_180.jpg" width="441" height="600"
     alt="Billings" title="Billings" />
</div>

<p>“Yes, sir, the same day they was
taking the others, sir. I had lopped
off the branches and was standin’ by
watching, sir, and after she had taken
that one there, sir, she said to me:
‘Billings, would you mind if I took’——”</p>

<p>“Not after she’d taken this, Billings,”
interrupted Ethan, in the interests
of accuracy. “She didn’t take
this one, of course.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, Mr. Ethan?”</p>

<p>“Never mind. I only said you
didn’t mean that it was after she had
taken this one; it was another one you
meant.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir, it was that very one,
sir. I had just lopped off the branches——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“You don’t mean that she took her
own picture, surely?” asked Ethan
with a smile.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“It was that one you have there,
sir, she took.”</p>

<p>“This one? Now, look here, Billings,
let’s get this straightened out
while we’re at it. Do you mean that
Miss Devereux—mind, I’m talking of
<em>Miss Devereux</em>—do you mean that
Miss Devereux took this photograph
I have in my hands?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, that’s the one. I had
just lopped——”</p>

<p>“Never mind the lopping,” interrupted
Ethan with smiling impatience.
“But tell me how she did it.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, she stood her camery
up a little ways off, sir; it had three
little legs onto it, sir; and she pressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
a little rubber ball, and the camery
went ‘click,’ sir, like that, sir,—‘click!’
and——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, but—now look here, how
far off was the camera from—from
this place, where you had lopped the
branches?”</p>

<p>“About twenty feet, sir, maybe.”</p>

<p>“Well, will you kindly, tell me
how Miss Devereux managed to
squeeze the little rubber ball and
get into the picture at the same
time?”</p>

<p>“Sir?”</p>

<p>“What I mean is,” answered
Ethan patiently, “how could she have
been here—” tapping the photograph
he held—“and at the camera the
same instant?”</p>

<p>That was evidently a poser. Billings
scratched the back of his head
dubiously. Finally,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“But she wasn’t there, sir!” he
explained.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t where? At the camera?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I mean no, sir. She
wasn’t there!” He pointed at the
picture.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t here!” exclaimed Ethan.
“Then how—hang it, man, but here’s
her picture!”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, Mr. Ethan?” Billings
looked both pained and puzzled,
and shot a quick look of inquiry at
the dinner table.</p>

<p>“I say here’s her picture, you
idiot!” repeated Ethan.</p>

<p>“Whose picture, sir?”</p>

<p>“Why, Miss Devereux’s!”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘no, sir?’
I say——”</p>

<p>A light broke upon Mr. Billings.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Ethan,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
he explained hurriedly. “I see your
mistake, sir, but you said as how you’d
met the young lady, and I thought you
understood as how that wasn’t her,
sir.”</p>

<p>“What? Who?”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t Miss Devereux, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that this isn’t Miss
Devereux here in this picture?” cried
Ethan.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; that is, no, sir. That
isn’t her, Mr. Ethan.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t—! Then who is it?”</p>

<p>“Miss Hoyt, sir. I thought you
under——”</p>

<p>Ethan took Billings by the arms and
forced him into a chair.</p>

<p>“You sit there and answer my
questions, Billings,” he commanded
excitedly. He held the photograph before
the gardener’s alarmed face.</p>

<p>“Who is this in the picture?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Hoyt, sir, as I was telling
you——”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You’re mistaken,
man! Look close; take it in your
hands! Don’t answer until you’ve
looked at it well. Where are your
spectacles?”</p>

<p>“I don’t wear any, sir,” was the
dignified reply. “My eyes, Mr.
Ethan, are just as clear as ever they
were, sir. Why, I can see——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I beg your pardon, Billings,
but I have most particular
reasons for wanting to be certain
about this! Now—take a good look at
it!—now who is she?”</p>

<p>“Miss Hoyt, sir, and if you was
to put me in jail the next minute, sir,
I wouldn’t say different! No, sir, not
if my life was depending on it, sir!”</p>

</div>

<p>“And it’s not Miss Devereux?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir, nor never was! Why,
Mr. Ethan, Miss Devereux, as you
must recall, sir, is quite tall and slim,
like—like a young birch, sir,—with
very dark hair. And Miss Hoyt, sir,
as you can see——”</p>

<p>Ethan planted himself with his back
to the fire and lighted a cigarette with
trembling fingers.</p>

<p>“Billings,” he said softly, “I’ve
been a damned fool!”</p>

<p>“Yes—that is, I can’t believe it,
sir,” was the respectful answer. But
Billings’ expression said otherwise.</p>

<p>“Now I want you to tell me all you
know about Miss Hoyt,” said Ethan.
“By the way, what was her first
name?”</p>

<p>“Cicely, sir; Miss Cicely Hoyt.”</p>

<p>“Cicely,” repeated Ethan softly.
“It just suits her!”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, never mind. Where does she
live?”</p>

<p>Billings thought in silence a moment.</p>

<p>“Ellington, sir,” he answered triumphantly,
evidently pleased at his
powers of memory.</p>

<p>“Where the deuce is that, though?”</p>

<p>“About the centre of the state, sir,
I think.”</p>

<p>“This state, do you mean? Massachusetts?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, Massachusetts.”</p>

<p>“And she was a friend of Miss
Devereux’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I gathered as how they
went to school together. And Miss
Hoyt’s father, sir, died a while back
and left her and her mother very
poorly off, sir. And the young lady
is employed in a library at Ellington,
as I understand it, sir, and her mother
is there, too, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the library?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, in Ellington. They used
to live in Ohio, I believe.”</p>

<p>Ethan was silent a moment, smoking
furiously. Then,</p>

<p>“Tell Farrell to come in here at
once, Billings. And I’m much obliged
for what you’ve told me. Oh, wait,
Billings! Throw another log on the
fire first. I don’t want it to go out;
you and I have got lots to talk about
to-night!”</p>

<p>Farrell came speedily.</p>

<p>“Do you know where Ellington,
Massachusetts, is?” asked Ethan.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“How long a run is it?”</p>

<p>Farrell produced a road map from
his coat pocket and bent over it under
the light.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Parmley, I don’t know
how the roads are now, sir, but supposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
they’re in fair condition we’d
ought to do it in about two and half
hours.”</p>

<p>“Then if we left here at seven in
the morning we’d get to Ellington by
noon?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t help it, sir, barring accidents.”</p>

<p>“There mustn’t be any accidents,”
answered Ethan, a bit unreasonably.</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best, sir.”</p>

<p>“Be ready to leave, then, promptly
at seven!”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p>Farrell went out and as the door
closed softly behind him Ethan, the
photograph in his hands, threw himself
into the chair before the fire and
beamed blissfully at the flames.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII">XIII.</a></h2>
</div>


<p>The library was filled with the
pallid twilight of a rainy day. Since
early morning the summit of Mount
Tom, a dozen miles to the westward,
had been enveloped in ponderous,
leaden clouds, and for two hours past
the storm, travelling along the Connecticut
Valley, had been deluging
the slopes with autumnal ferocity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_191.jpg" width="600" height="167"
     alt="rainy day" title="rainy day" />
</div>

<p>Through the rain-drenched windows
a cold white light entered, flooding the
stack room with its iron tiers of slumbering
volumes, and, here at the barrier-like
counter, illumining faintly
the rebellious brown hair of the girl
who, with pen in hand, bent over the
pile of catalogue cards. The library
was very still, so still that the sibilation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of the moving pen sounded portentously
loud. Now and then the rustle
of a turning leaf or the scraping of
feet on the floor came from around the
corner of the arched doorway where
sat a solitary occupant of the reading
room. Save for these two the library
was deserted. The hands of the clock
above the commemorative tablet pointed
to a quarter past twelve and the
stack-boy and the assistant librarian
had both gone to their luncheons.</p>

<p>A more prolonged scraping of feet,
followed by the sound of a moving
chair, caused the girl at the desk to
raise her head and pause at her work.
A little frown of annoyance gathered
and then gave place to a smile of
humorous resignation as footfalls
sounded on the echoing silence. From
the reading room emerged a tall, thin
youth of about twenty, a youth with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
pale, cadaverous face lighted by a
pair of patient, contemplative brown
eyes which looked strangely incongruous
and out of place. He carried
two books which he laid apologetically
on the counter.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Miss Hoyt,” he said
gently.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Winkley?” she asked,
looking up.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to trouble you,
but could you let me have Burton’s
Anatomy of Melancholy?”</p>

<p>“Have—What did you say,
please?” she asked startledly.</p>

<p>“Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy,
please,” he repeated in his patient
voice. She turned hurriedly and disappeared
into the stack room. Once
out of sight she leaned against one of
the cases and laughed silently and
hysterically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh,” she thought, “if he doesn’t
stop it and go away I shall have to—to—I
shall go crazy!”</p>

<p>Presently, with a final gasp, she
brushed the back of her hand across
her eyes and went on down the concrete
aisle in search of the volume.
Out at the counter, the youth, left to
himself, watched her while she was in
sight and then leaned across to peer
at the neatly arranged cards. She had
left her handkerchief beside her work.
With a timorous glance about him, he
reached forward, picked it up and with
a quick, vehement movement pressed
it to his thin, unsmiling lips. He held
it so a moment, his brown eyes staring
widely through the rain-bleared window
as though beholding visions. Then,
as her steps came back toward him,
he laid the handkerchief again in its
place, straightened himself and waited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here it is, Mr. Winkley,” she
said soberly.</p>

<p>“Thank you. I am sorry to trouble
you,” he answered gravely.</p>

<p>“It is only what I am here for,”
she answered coldly, taking up her pen
once more. He remained for an instant
looking at the bent head. Then,
lifting the Anatomy of Melancholy
from the counter, he turned and
walked slowly and quite noiselessly
back to his table. But as he went the
ghost of a sigh trembled across the
silence.</p>

<p>The girl raised her head with a despairing
glance toward the reading
room, jabbed her pen viciously into
the ink-stand and went on with her
writing. The clock overhead ticked
slowly and softly. The rain <em>swished</em>
past the windows.</p>

<p>But presently a new sound made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
itself heard. Dim at first, it grew
insistently until the girl heard it and
again lifted her head and listened with
a new light in her violet eyes.</p>

<p><em>Chug-chug, chug-chug-chug, chug-chug!</em></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_196.jpg" width="600" height="215"
     alt="big blue touring car" title="big blue touring car" />
</div>

<p>Automobiles are not common in
Ellington, especially after the summer
colony departs, and the approach of
this one brought a tinge of color to
the soft cheeks and a flutter to the
heart of the librarian. So often during
the past three months she had listened
with straining ears to the panting
of an automobile on the road
below! Usually the sound had died
away again in the distance, and she
had told herself, sighing, that she was
very glad. But to-day the sounds increased
every instant. The <em>chug-chug</em>
was slower now and more labored;
the car had left the village road and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
was climbing the circling gravelled
drive to the library. Every beat
brought an answering beat from her
heart.</p>

<p>Oh, it was foolish! she told herself
angrily. And she didn’t want it to
happen! She hoped it wouldn’t!
Resolutely she began her work again,
but the noise of the approaching machine
seemed to fill the world with a
tumult of sound. Then, close at hand,
the measured <em>chugs</em> suddenly became
hurried and incoherent, as though the
intruding monster was violently incensed
at being stopped. Then—silence,
appalling, portentous! With
white face the girl bent closer to her
desk, her pen tracing quivering figures
and letters. The outer door opened
and closed again with a muffled jar.
She heard the <em>swish ... swish</em> of
the inner doors as they swung inward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and back. Firm footfalls sounded on
the oaken floor. Very different they
were from the soft tread of the library
habitué, and there was a determined,
resolute character to them that put the
brown-haired librarian in a panic.
Oh, how she wished that she had
fled while there had been time! She
no longer doubted; the unexpected,
which all along had been the expected,
had happened; the thing which she
had feared, and always hoped for, had
come to pass. The steps came nearer,
straight from the doorway, scorning
the longer and quieter paths provided
by the cocoa-fibre matting. The
brown head still bent over the desk.
Then the footsteps stopped. A terrible
silence fell over the room. There
was no help for it.</p>

<p>Slowly, reluctantly the girl raised
her head.</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV">XIV.</a></h2>
</div>


<p>Had they lived in the Age of Stone
that meeting might have proved far
more interesting for purposes of description.
As it was, both being fairly
conventional characters of the Twentieth
Century, the affair was disappointingly
commonplace.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Miss Hoyt?” he
asked, smiling calmly and reaching a
hand across the counter. And,——</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/i_199_212.jpg" width="344" height="350"
     alt="Cicely Hoyt" title="Cicely Hoyt" />
</div>

<p>“Why, Mr. Parmley!” she replied,
laying her own hand for an instant
in his.</p>

<p>A close observer, and both you and
I, patient reader, pride ourselves
upon being such, would have noticed,
perhaps, that in spite of the commonplace
words and the unembarrassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
manners, the man’s cheeks held an unaccustomed
tinge of color and the
girl’s face was more than ordinarily
pale. And could we have enjoyed a
physician’s privilege of examining the
heart-action at that moment we would
have straightened ourselves up with
very knowing smiles.</p>

<p>“I’ve come,” he said, as the soft
hand drew itself away from his, “to
return a book. Is this the right
place?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied brightly.</p>

<p>“Thank you. I don’t know very
much about libraries; I always avoid
them as much as possible as being
rather too exciting.” He took a small
book from the pocket of his coat and
laid it on the counter. “I’m afraid
there’s a good deal to pay on it. It’s
been out quite a while.”</p>

<p>A tinge of color came into her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
cheeks as she took the volume. It
was a copy of “Love Sonnets from
the Portuguese.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll let you off,” she answered
gayly. “We sometimes remit the
fines when the excuse is good.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. My excuse is excellent.
I only yesterday discovered the
identity of the loaner.”</p>

<p>“Only yesterday?” she asked
carelessly, but with quickening heart.</p>

<p>“To be exact, at about eight o’clock
last evening.” He dropped his voice
and leaned a little further across the
barrier. “You see, Miss Hoyt, you
fooled me very nicely.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Mr. Parmley, you
fooled yourself. I told you—at least,
I never said I was Laura Devereux.”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t, but—I wonder
why I was so certain you were! If I
hadn’t been——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Miss Hoyt,
but will you please let me have Swinburne’s
Poems?”</p>

<p>It was the solitary reader. The girl
disappeared into the stack room, leaving
the two men to a furtive and, on
one part at least, amused examination
of each other. The pale youth, however,
showed no amusement; rather
his look expressed suspicion and resentment.
Ethan, unable longer to
encounter that baleful glare without
smiling, turned his head. Then the
librarian came with the desired book.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Hoyt!” said the
reader. With a final glance of dawning
enmity at Ethan he returned to his
solitude. Ethan looked inquiringly at
Cicely.</p>

<p>“He’s perfectly awful!” she replied
despairingly. “He stays here
hours and hours at a time. I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
believe he ever eats anything. And
he calls for books incessantly, from
Plutarch’s Lives to—to Swinburne!
I think he is trying to read right
through the catalogue. And a while
ago he came for—what do you think?—The
Anatomy of Melancholy!”</p>

<p>Ethan smiled gently.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be too hard on him,”
he said. “The poor devil is head-over-heels
in love with you.”</p>

<p>The phrase brought recollections—and
a blush.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! He’s just a boy!”
she answered.</p>

<p>“Boys sometimes feel pretty deeply—for
the while,” he replied. “And
judging from his present line of reading,
I’d say that the while hasn’t
passed yet.”</p>

<p>“It’s so silly and tiresome!” she
said. “He gets terribly on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
nerves. He—he sighs—in the most
heartbreaking way!” She laughed a
little nervously. Then a moment of
silence followed.</p>

<p>“Clytie,” he began,—“I am going
to call you that to-day, for I haven’t
got used to thinking of you as Cicely
yet—do you know why I came?”</p>

<p>“To return the book,” she answered
smilingly.</p>

<p>“No, not altogether. I came to ask
you something.”</p>

<p>“I ought to feel flattered, oughtn’t
I? It’s quite a ways here from Providence,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Supposing we don’t pretend,” he
answered gravely. “We’ve gone too
far to make that possible, don’t you
think? And I’ve had a beast of a summer,”
he added inconsequently. “I
thought—do you know what I thought,
dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“How should I?” she asked
weakly.</p>

<p>“I thought you were Laura Devereux,
and that day when you didn’t
come I went for you and saw you and
Vincent on the porch. And afterwards
he told me he was engaged to
Miss Devereux, and—don’t you see
what it meant to me? And yesterday
I found out, quite by accident, and—”
he reached across and seized her hand
with a little laugh of sheer happiness—“I
haven’t slept a wink since! I—I
thought I’d never get here; the
roads were quagmires!”</p>

<p>“Oh, why did you come?” she
asked miserably.</p>

<p>“Why? Good Heaven, don’t you
know, girl?” He leaned across and
she felt his lips on the hand still
clasped in his.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know,” she cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
“But—you mustn’t love me! You
won’t when I’ve told you!”</p>

<p>“Try me!” he said softly.</p>

<p>“I’m going to. But—I can’t if you
have my hand.”</p>

<p>“If I let it go may I have it
again?” he asked playfully.</p>

<p>“You won’t want it,” was the grim
answer. “When you know what I am
really, you—won’t want—ever to see
me—again.”</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense,” he answered
stoutly. But a qualm of uneasiness
oppressed him.</p>

<p>She moved away from the counter
until she was out of reach of his
impatient hands.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 427px;">
<img src="images/i_206.jpg" width="427" height="600"
     alt="Cicely" title="Cicely" />
</div>

<p>“I meant you to fall in love with
me,” she said evenly, looking at him
with wide eyes and white face. “I
meant you to propose to me. I wanted
to—to marry you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>He reached impetuously toward her
with a smothered word of endearment,
but she held up a hand.</p>

<p>“Wait! You don’t understand! I—I
didn’t care for you. I was tired of
being poor and—and of this!” She
swept her glance about the bare and
silent library. “We used to have
money,” she went on, speaking rapidly.
“We lived in Ohio then, when
father was alive. Then I came east
to college. I met Laura there. We
were friends almost at once, although
she was in the class ahead of me. I
never finished, for my father died and
left us almost without a cent. I left
college and Laura’s father secured me
work here. I studied hard and last
year they made me librarian. Then
mother came east to live here with me.
Laura was always kind. When my
vacation came I went to visit her there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
at The Larches. Then you—I met
you.”</p>

<p>She paused and dropped her gaze.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said softly. “And
then?”</p>

<p>“You said you had some property
and you—you seemed nice and kind.
I was so weary of it all. I wanted—oh,
you know? I wanted to have
money, enough to live decently somewhere
else than here in this tomb they
call a town. I didn’t care. I set out
to make you—like me. I went back
there to the pool each day for just
that, until——”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 320px;">
<img src="images/i_208.jpg" width="320" height="1393"
     alt="lily pond" title="lily pond" />
</div>

<p>“Well? Until?” he urged, smiling
across at her.</p>

<p>“That is all,” she answered.</p>

<p>“And it was all absolutely mercenary?
You never cared for me?”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you,” she answered.</p>

<p>“And—that last day, dear? It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the same? You didn’t care then
either?”</p>

<p>“Oh, what does it matter what happened
afterwards?” she cried agitatedly.
“It was what I had done,
don’t you see? It was the meanness,
the—the shamefulness of it!”</p>

<p>“Well, but this ‘afterward’?
What of that?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she answered firmly.</p>

<p>Silence fell for a moment. They
looked across at each other steadily,
she meeting his smile defiantly. Then
the color crept up from throat to
cheeks and her eyes dropped.</p>

<p>“Dear,” he said gently, “I don’t
care what happened before that
‘afterward.’ I loved you from the
first moment, but I’m not going to resent
it if it took you longer to discover
my irresistible charms. Why,
hang it all, I’m proud you should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
thought me worth marrying even for
my money! But ‘afterward,’ dear?
When I kissed you? You can’t make
me believe there was no love then,
Cicely. And it is still ‘afterward,’
and it always will be! Dear, Arcadia
is waiting for you. The lotus pool is
lonely without you. And so am I,
Cicely, Cicely dear!”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 424px;">
<img src="images/i_210.jpg" width="424" height="600"
     alt="Ethan and Cicely" title="Ethan and Cicely" />
</div>

<p>“Oh, I knew you would try to forgive
me,” she cried miserably. “That
is why I—didn’t want you to come.
Because after awhile you would remember
and——”</p>

<p>“Cicely!”</p>

<p>“And you’d hate me!”</p>

<p>“Cicely! Look at me, dear! I
want you to——”</p>

<p>Soft footfalls reached them. The
pale youth was approaching, his arms
laden with books. Ethan bit his lip
and fell silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Miss Hoyt, but
would you mind giving me——”</p>

<p>Ethan stepped toward him.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said hurriedly, “here’s
just what you’re after. It’s no
trouble at all.” He forced the “Love
Sonnets from the Portuguese,” into
the youth’s hands and turned him
gently but firmly away from the
counter. The youth looked from the
book to Ethan.</p>

<p>“How—how did you know?” he
stammered resentfully.</p>

<p>“Never mind how, my boy. You’ve
got it. Run along.”</p>

<p>After a moment of indecision, of
many silent looks of inquiry and dark
suspicion, the youth trod softly away
again. Ethan looked at Cicely and
they smiled together. Then she sank
into her chair at the desk and laughed
helplessly, and cried a little, too. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Ethan said no word until she had
pressed the handkerchief to her eyes
and turned toward him again. Then,</p>

<p>“Will you come back to your lotus
pool, O Clytie?” he asked softly.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be rather cold and
damp this weather?” she asked with
a little trembling laugh.</p>

<p>“I am going to have it steam-heated,”
he answered gravely. “I
was there yesterday, Clytie, and it
looked very forlorn without you,
dear.”</p>

<p>“You were there?” she asked
wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Yes. I forgot to tell you, didn’t
I? The Larches is mine, dear, and
the lotus pool shall be yours for life,
if you’ll let me come sometimes and
sit beside you under the trees on the
bank. Will you?”</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#i_212fp">“Will you?” he repeated.</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 526px;">
<a id="i_212fp">
  <img src="images/i_212fp.jpg" width="526" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_213">“WILL YOU?” HE REPEATED.</a></div>
</div>

<p>She moved nearer, with lowered
head, and laid her hands palms up on
the oaken counter. He took them and
drew her toward him. She raised a
rosy face toward him, the violet eyes
darting fearfully toward the reading
room. Ethan paused and looked
thoughtful.</p>

<p>“In nice libraries,” he said, “they
have what they call the open stacks.
Is it so here?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“But—there might be exceptions?”</p>

<p>“There might,” she answered
softly.</p>

<p>“And do you think the librarian
would permit me to be an exception?”</p>

<p>She nodded, blushing and provoking.</p>

<p>He turned, walked to the end of the
counter and pushed aside the swinging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
gate. At the door of the stack room
he paused.</p>

<p>“I would like,” he said, “to find
that book of mythology wherein are
related the loves of Clytie and Vertumnus.
Could you show me where to
find it?”</p>

<p>She darted a glance toward the entrance
to the reading room. Then she
followed him.</p>

<p>“I believe,” she murmured, as her
hand stole into his, “I believe it is in
the farthest corner.”</p>

<p>Their footfalls died away down the
concrete aisle. From the reading
room came the sound of a softly
turned leaf. Then the library was
